## Highlights
- These politicians are guided by forms of logic that are alien to economists—I’ve called them political logic to distinguish them from Aristotelian logic (Blinder 2018). Nonetheless, no history of fiscal policy can avoid delving, sometimes deeply, into the politics of the day. Writing a history of fiscal policy in America that ignored the politics would be leaving out of the play not just the Prince of Denmark but also Ophelia, Laertes, and Polonius.
