## Highlights
- You can’t be a successful B2B organization in today’s world (no matter what the date is today, whenever you’re reading this) without going after the right customers, creating experiences designed just for them, and turning them into advocates for your product or service.

    - Note: Obsession with the customer a la Amazon
- Marketing research firm Forrester discovered that fewer than one percent of all leads turn into customers. Put that another way: 99% of what you’re doing now doesn’t work. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=233))

- We want you to train yourself and your teams to adopt an account-based mindset and let it worm its way into your entire operation until it becomes, for lack of a better phrase, just how you do things. ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=253))

- B2B is not a marketing thing that marketers should figure out. It’s a business thing, and our job is to create business outcomes. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=306))

    - Note: Marketing and sales initiatives at SFL need to be more unified. Marketing initiatives right now are handed off to junior members who fumble them. That needs to change
- The number-one company killer isn’t lack of growth; it’s a poor retention rate. ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=319))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Customer obsession and support leads to retention rate. Make sure to get into accounts and then serve them to the absolute best of your ability
- ABM isn’t a marketing thing for marketers. It’s a cross-functional approach to being account-centric and customer-obsessed. ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=325))

- We learned early on the value of running short sprints to show success. Go to your executives with your universe already trimmed to the best-fit accounts, the right verticals, the ideal company sizes, and hammer home the concept of targeting and nurturing customers that will generate revenue (you know, speak the CEO language for a bit). ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=352))

- To start doing something better, you must stop doing something else. That might seem vague, but B2B is really about taking the most efficient route to reach the right customers. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=386))

- One of our biggest early stories of customer success was an IT company that applied account-based thinking to cross-sell, up-sell (or up-serve, as we like to call it), and mentor current customers. We had never considered that. Suddenly, ABM was proving to be a multifaceted strategy adaptable for the entire customer life cycle. ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=402))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- We ran a campaign for 10 accounts instead of 500, and saw engagement in five of them. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=431))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Your first pilot might be one campaign for one customer. That’s not a failure, but an incredible opportunity to define your metrics of success. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=437))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Not all accounts are equal in value, so why are you creating equal experiences for them? It’s okay to play favorites—in fact, it’s necessary! Assigning tiers is the fairest way to make sure you design experiences that reflect what each account is worth. Your top tier gets wined and dined; your bottom tier gets Sprite and takeout. A B2B approach gives such powerful insights into your accounts that you can decide how much to care about each of them. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=453))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- If you have an account that’s worth a million dollars, care more! Pour everything you have into focused direct mail, a landing page with content tailored to that account and your support, a microsite all about them, a private dinner, and anything else that acknowledges how valuable the account is to you. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=456))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- We don’t organize dinners to pitch potential customers one-on-one; that’s a sales trick, and they see right through it. Instead, we invite CMOs from their industry who happen to be our customers and position the dinner as a networking event, an opportunity to meet people they otherwise wouldn’t.

- Because this ABM effort was so focused on retaining current customers, Thomson Reuters knew it wasn’t enough to be aligned just between sales and marketing; sales and account management had to be working as one team, too. No one knows an account better than the people working on it every day, and this partnership established trust that sales would be enabled with the correct strategy for key accounts. ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=563))

- the ABM team leveraged new digital efforts such as personalized web experiences, gamification, more robust email and web marketing, and routine surveys to stay on top of customer needs. ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=569))

- Customers in the early stages of a long renewal cycle were put on hold with a marketing strategy, then re-engaged with sales at a more tactical level when the time was right. ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=573))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Focus targeted sales on strategically important accounts (high probability new accounts and existing accounts up for renewal)
- Including all accounts in an account-centric program was impossible, so it became critical to evaluate the most important techniques and tactics that would achieve scale within their target list and resources. Thomson Reuters landed on a combination of high-touch and high-tech to create powerful, blended messaging strategies. The marketing team created personalized web experiences based on IP backtracking data and leveraged online content syndication while sending impactful direct mail and attending relevant events. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=576))

    - Note: Personalized web experiences & email marketing leads to higher win rates
- treating the sales and account management teams as though they are customers. The ABM team sends out twice-yearly surveys to check the program’s pulse, asking sales and account managers where they’re seeing value and giving them a platform to provide feedback. This helps the organization make future investments in the right places. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=590))

- Their multi-channel engagement strategy for this account included 1:1 ads, outbound calls with personalized messaging and direct mail, and email nurture programs that kept their brand in front of all the key stakeholders at the airline.

- They gathered data and learned about customer challenges to identify opportunities to cross-sell. Marketers and account managers aligned on 1:1 engagement campaigns tailored to specific customer cases. They were ready with the perfect message at the perfect time, just as if they were trying to acquire a new customer. It was genius. By applying this approach to their current customer base, Masergy saw five times as much engagement from targeted accounts and a 40% increase in opportunity creation. And because they kept personal relationships and continued to serve relevant, high-touch content, their net promoter score jumped from 70% to 90%.

- Pramata went right to the top with its initial ABM program, targeting sales ops and finance executives at 332 tech companies. They rebuilt the entire process and optimized tactics with the goal of simplifying everything. The first move? Eliminating the pointless form fills on their website. CFOs weren’t searching for Pramata, and engagements with people who were visiting the site were meaningless. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=677))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- education had to come before engagement. Their small sales and marketing teams worked together to develop personalized messaging aimed at the few individuals who understood the problem of revenue leakage. Paring down the target list allowed Pramata’s sales team to research the 10 to 20 people who cared and drive them to the website or curated event. ([Location 680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=680))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Through an account-centric approach focused on targeting the right people and spreading the knowledge about revenue leakage, Pramata increased its inbound lead volume from one per quarter to five to seven, halving their deal time with those leads.

([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=729))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Ads evolved from “Snowflake + your company name” to “Hey, customer, here’s how we can help you solve one specific problem.” As the team members put it, they wanted viewers to understand they’d just been “ABM’ed.” ([Location 732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=732))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- of the 1,000 campaigns Snowflake was running, there wasn’t a single form or piece of gated content to be found. Instead, the team became master retargeters, building credibility with the audience before driving viewers to more traditional conversion actions, such as demonstrations or free trials.

([Location 780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07VG62DRT&location=780))
    - Tags: [[blue]]

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Sigstr took an aggressive account-based approach to become legit players in their category. They went from having an ideal customer that theoretically could have been any company in the world to creating personalized experiences for a tight list of about 2,000 companies.

- total addressable market, which is every company in the conceivable universe that you could sell to. To do B2B right, you do not want to sell to all of them! As opposed to lead-based B2B marketing, which welcomes all potential customers to the pipeline, ABM says it’s necessary to ignore a large percentage of your TAM in order to find the rich account nuggets you can mine for gold over and over again.
