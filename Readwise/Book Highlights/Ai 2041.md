## Highlights
- The popular 2020 documentary The Social Dilemma illustrates how AI’s personalization will cause you to be unconsciously manipulated by AI and motivated by profit from advertising. The Social Dilemma star Tristan Harris says: “You didn’t know that your click caused a supercomputer to be pointed at your brain. Your click activated billions of dollars of computing power that has learned much from its experience of tricking two billion human animals to click again.” ([Location 684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08QMFMJ1H&location=684))

- So, is 100-percent detection of deepfakes hopeless?

- In addition to making deepfakes, GANs can be used for constructive tasks, such as to age or de-age photos, colorize black-and-white movies and photos, make animated paintings (such as Mona Lisa), enhance resolution, detect glaucoma, predict climate change effects, and even discover new drugs.
