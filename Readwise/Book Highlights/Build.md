## Highlights
- The world is full of mediocre, middle-of-the-road companies creating mediocre, middle-of-the-road crap, but I’ve spent my entire life chasing after the products and people that strive for excellence. I’ve been incredibly lucky to learn from the best—from bold, passionate people who made a dent in the world. ([Location 63](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=63))

- Adulthood is your opportunity to screw up continually until you learn how to screw up a little bit less. ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=222))

- The best way to find a job you’ll love and a career that will eventually make you successful is to follow what you’re naturally interested in, then take risks when choosing where to work. Follow your curiosity rather than a business school playbook about how to make money. Assume that for much of your twenties your choices will not work out and the companies you join or start will likely fail. Early adulthood is about watching your dreams go up in flames and learning as much as you can from the ashes. Do, fail, learn. The rest will follow.

- it felt more like treading water. And treading water felt like drowning. Either you’re growing or you’re done. There is no stasis. ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=241))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Always put yourself into situations where you’re learning and growing
- “The only failure in your twenties is inaction. The rest is trial and error.” —ANONYMOUS I needed to learn. And the best way to do that was to surround myself with people who knew exactly how hard it was to make something great—who had the scars to prove it. And if it turned out to be the wrong move, well, making a mistake is the best way to not make that mistake again. Do, fail, learn. The critical thing is to have a goal. To strive for something big and hard and important to you. Then every step you take toward that goal, even if it’s a stumble, moves you forward. ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=256))

- It’s thinking about a problem or a customer need in a way you’ve never heard before, but which makes perfect sense once you hear it. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=357))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- If you do choose to go that route and find yourself at one of the Big Four or the other top six firms, then that is of course your choice. Just know before you go what you want to learn and the experiences you need for your next chapter. Don’t get stuck. Management consulting should never be your endpoint—it should be a way station, a brief pause on your journey to actually doing something. Making something. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=403))

    - Note: What you’re getting out of SFL/Deloitte: sales, pitching, networking, slide design, management (also get more hands-on in drug discovery work for coding)
- If you’re passionate about something—something that could be solving a huge problem one day—then stick with it. Look around and find the community of people who are passionate about it, too. ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=421))

- I had gained a huge amount of practical, useful information through sheer brute force. I spent most of my time building—chips and software and devices and companies—and the rest of my time reading everything I could get my hands on about the industry. And that’s what set me apart. That’s what can set anyone apart. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=450))

      The learn-do feedback loop will accelerate you past everyone else

- The key is persistence and being helpful. Not just asking for something, but offering something. You always have something to offer if you’re curious and engaged. You can always trade and barter good ideas; you can always be kind and find a way to help. ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=469))

- It’s easy to mistake navigating processes, red tape, job leveling, and politics for real personal growth. ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=488))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Stop looking at levels.fyi and job postings. 
      Learn and build. Simple as that
- That’s the great thing about heroes. You can use their inspiration to drive you. If you do it right, and listen carefully, they’ll share decades of learning. And then, one day, you might return the favor. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=511))

- Your job isn’t just doing your job. It’s also to think like your manager or CEO. You need to understand the ultimate goal, even if it’s so far away that you’re not really sure what it’ll look like when you get there. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=551))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: You were very good at this at SFL but not so much at Deloitte. Make a conscious effort to look at the big pictures of everything you’re working on (especially drug discovery). Plot out the path
- Some people will see things you can’t, and you’ll see things that are invisible to everyone else. So don’t think doing the work just means locking yourself in a room—a huge part of it is walking with your team. The work is reaching your destination together. Or finding a new destination and bringing your team with you. ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=597))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Trust your perspective and judgement more. Act on your ideas and share them (eg cost saving ideas to keep sales growth going strong)
- It was so glaringly, wonderfully obvious. Make a product for people who already saw the need and felt the pain daily. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=614))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Orient product first at early adopters, then go for general public
- we had put together all the right pieces except one: a real sales and retail partnership. Another lesson learned via gut punch. ([Location 663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=663))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: There needs to be a tight coupling between development, marketing, and sales
- Being exacting and expecting great work is not micromanagement. Your job is to make sure the team produces high-quality work. It only turns into micromanagement when you dictate the step-by-step process by which they create that work rather than focusing on the output. ([Location 710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=710))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Keep this in mind. Expect high quality work from yourself and others
- Honesty is more important than style. Everyone has a style—loud, quiet, emotional, analytical, excited, reserved. You can be successful with any style as long as you never shy away from respectfully telling the team the uncomfortable, hard truth that needs to be said. ([Location 713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=713))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Speak your mind always
- I constantly have to remind people: If you’re doing what you loved in your old job, then you’re probably doing the wrong thing. You now lead a team of people doing what you used to be good at. So at least 85 percent of your time should be spent managing. If it’s not, then you aren’t doing it right. Managing is the job. And managing is hard. ([Location 733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=733))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- You can’t let it slide into mediocrity because you’re worried about seeming overbearing. Even if your hands aren’t on the product, they should still be on the wheel. Examining the product in great detail and caring deeply about the quality of what your team is producing is not micromanagement. ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=787))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Don’t be afraid to have exceedingly high standards
- Write down a list of what you’re worried about for each project and person so you can immediately see when the list is getting too long and you need to either dive deeper or back off. ([Location 803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=803))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Starting writing down lists of topics to address in weekly sprint meetings
- It’s all too easy to turn 1:1s into friendly chats that go nowhere, so just as you need to have a process for your team meetings, your weekly meetings with individuals should have an agenda, a clear purpose, and should be beneficial to both sides. You should get the info you need about product development and your team members should get insight into how they’re doing. Try to see the situation from their point of view—talk about their fears and your own concerns out loud, reframe your thoughts so they can hear the feedback, understand the goals, clear up ambiguities or concerns. ([Location 805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=805))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Set up a 1-1 framework with Ben. Also start 1-1s with Michael and set up a framework for him
- You have to tell the team why. Why am I this passionate? Why is this mission meaningful? Why is this small detail so important that I’m flipping out right now when nobody else seems to think it matters? Nobody wants to follow someone who throws themselves at windmills for no reason. To get people to join you, to truly become a team, to fill them with the same energy and drive that’s bubbling within you, you need to tell them the why. ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=852))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Push the grand vision in meetings, remind the team what we’re doing
- “Most managers are afraid that the people who work for them are going to be better than them. But you need to think of being a manager more like being a mentor or a parent. What loving parent wants their child NOT to succeed? You want your kids to be more successful than you, right?” ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=866))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Many people don’t have either a good gut instinct to follow or the faith in themselves to follow it. It takes time to develop that trust. ([Location 901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=901))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- If you don’t have enough data to make a decision, you’ll need insights to inform your opinion. Insights can be key learnings about your customers or your market or your product space—something substantial that gives you an intuitive feeling for what you should do. You can also get outside input: talk to the experts and confer with your team. ([Location 904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=904))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Triangulate expert opinions and customer opinions
- We did user testing as we finished up engineering, but I’m pretty sure we did little to no user research before that. We had no idea what Joe Sixpack might want, so we built features that we liked and just assumed the rest of the world would fall in line. ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=910))

- customer panels can’t design for shit. People just can’t articulate what they want clearly enough to definitely point in one direction or another, especially if they’re considering something completely new that they’ve never used before. Customers will always be more comfortable with what exists already, even if it’s terrible. ([Location 925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=925))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Something totally new and novel can’t rely totally on data because customers don’t yet know they want it. Instead clarify the PAIN point rather than the solution. Use that highly specific pain point to create a product idea
- Despite the fact that many companies now rabidly test every single element of their product and unquestioningly follow the clicks, A/B and user testing is not product design. It’s a tool. A test. At best, a diagnosis. It can tell you something’s not working, but it won’t tell you how to fix it. Or it can show you an option that solves one hyperlocal issue but breaks something else downstream. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=938))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- So you have to design the options and the tests to really know what you’re testing. You have to think through what A and B are rather than let them be randomly assigned by an algorithm or thoughtlessly thrown against a wall to see what sticks. And that takes insight and knowledge of the entire customer journey. You need a hypothesis, and that hypothesis should be part of a bigger product vision. So you can A/B test where the “Buy” button should go on a Web page, whether it should be blue or orange, but you shouldn’t be testing whether or not a customer should buy online. ([Location 941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=941))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- If a product is really new, there’s nothing to compare it to, nothing to optimize, nothing to test. ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=948))

- So what do you do when you’re stuck with a manager who’s hell-bent on driving off a cliff, ideally while throwing all their money out the window at some consultants? Or what if you have data but it’s inconclusive—nobody can say for sure where it leads? Or what if you need to convince your team to follow you even though you can’t prove you’re heading in the right direction? You tell a story. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=987))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Storytelling is THE skill. To go from zero to one, you can’t rely fully on market research and data. At some point you’ll have to make something new and innovative. And in that case, you’ll need to tell a compelling story to convince people that what you’ve built is worth using
- “It’s not data or intuition; it’s data and intuition.” You need both. You use both. And sometimes the data can only take you so far. In those moments, all you can do is take a leap. Just don’t look down. ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1007))

- pushing for greatness doesn’t make you an asshole. Not tolerating mediocrity doesn’t make you an asshole. Challenging assumptions doesn’t make you an asshole. ([Location 1066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1066))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Be more willing to do these things yourself. Don’t be afraid to push for greatness and to demand it from others
- I just mean make new relationships, beyond business—talk to people outside your bubble. Get to know what else is out there. Meet some new human beings. Networking is something you should be doing constantly—even when you’re happily employed. ([Location 1216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1216))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: You need to be much better about networking outside of Deloitte. Go to meetups. Make connections in tech and VC
- You want your projects to be successful, so you don’t just talk to your immediate teammates at lunch—you grab lunch with your partners, your customers, their customers, their partners. You talk to everyone: get their ideas and their perspectives. In doing so you may be able to help someone or make a friend or strike up an interesting conversation. ([Location 1228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1228))

- I spent nine years at Apple. It’s the place where I finally grew up. I wasn’t just managing a team anymore. I was leading hundreds, thousands of people. It was a profound shift in my career and in who I was. After a decade of failure, I finally made something—actually two things—that people actually wanted. I finally got it right. ([Location 1405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1405))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Failure after failure leading to ultimate success. But the key is he spent the whole time BUILDING. He tried and was daring and honed his skills, both in engineering and management
- So don’t just make a prototype of your product and think you’re done. Prototype as much of the full customer experience as possible. Make the intangible tangible so you can’t overlook the less showy but incredibly important parts of the journey. You should be able to map out and visualize exactly how a customer discovers, considers, installs, uses, fixes, and even returns your product. It all matters. ([Location 1421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1421))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Think about and improve the WHOLE customer experience. From before they touch your product to after they give it up
- The only time hardware is worth the headache of manufacturing and packaging and shipping is if it’s critically necessary and transformative. If hardware doesn’t absolutely need to exist to enable the overall experience, then it should not exist. ([Location 1438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1438))

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Your product isn’t only your product. It’s the whole user experience—a chain that begins when someone learns about your brand for the first time and ends when your product disappears from their life, returned or thrown away, sold to a friend or deleted in a burst of electrons. ([Location 1441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1441))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Your customer doesn’t differentiate between your advertising and your app and your customer support agents—all of it is your company. Your brand. All of it is one thing. But we forget. Too often makers only think of the user experience as that moment when the customer touches an object or taps a screen. The moment they actually use the thing—whether it’s made of atoms or bits or both. The thing is always central. ([Location 1449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1449))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Keep the whole customer journey in your mind, not just the product. Optimize the entire experience
- If we didn’t execute well on any one of these parts of the customer experience, Nest would have failed. Each phase of the journey has to be great in order to move customers naturally into the next, to overcome the moments of friction between them. ([Location 1472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1472))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- you have to prototype the whole experience—give every part the weight and reality of a physical object. Regardless of whether your product is made of atoms or bits or both, the process is the same. Draw pictures. Make models. Pin mood boards. Sketch out the bones of the process in rough wireframes. Write imaginary press releases. Create detailed mock-ups that show how a customer would travel from an ad to the website to the app and what information they would see at each touchpoint. Write up the reactions you’d want to get from early adopters, the headlines you’d want to see from reviewers, the feelings you want to evoke in everyone. Make it visible. Physical. Get it out of your head and onto something you can touch. And don’t wait until your product is done to get started—map out the whole journey as you map out what your product will do. ([Location 1480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1480))

- Start from that very first moment of the customer journey. You should be prototyping your marketing long before you have anything to market. ([Location 1487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1487))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- That’s how prototyping works. It’s how you make abstract concepts into physical representations. You turn your messaging architecture into words and pictures on a box. [See also: Figure 5.4.1, in Chapter 5.4.] You turn “someone in a store” into Beth from Pennsylvania. ([Location 1513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1513))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Make your abstract ideas about every part of the customer journey concrete. Get everything down in images and text and videos
- if we hadn’t thought about the full customer life cycle—from discovery to support to loyalty—we would have just made the kind of tiny, one-use screwdriver that comes with IKEA furniture. Instead we included four heads—more than anyone needed to install the thermostat—so that people could use it for practically anything. So that Nest stayed in their brains as long as the screwdriver stayed in their drawer. Longer. ([Location 1560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1560))

- Every product should have a story, a narrative that explains why it needs to exist and how it will solve your customer’s problems. A good product story has three elements: »  It appeals to people’s rational and emotional sides. »  It takes complicated concepts and makes them simple. » It reminds people of the problem that’s being solved—it focuses on the “why.” ([Location 1569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1569))

- anyone encountering your product for the first time won’t have the context you have. You can’t just hit customers on the head with the “what” before you tell them the “why.” ([Location 1575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1575))

- He used a technique I later came to call the virus of doubt. It’s a way to get into people’s heads, remind them about a daily frustration, get them annoyed about it all over again. If you can infect them with the virus of doubt—“Maybe my experience isn’t as good as I thought, maybe it could be better”—then you prime them for your solution. You get them angry about how it works now so they can get excited about a new way of doing things. ([Location 1599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1599))

- And the reason is simple: Steve didn’t just read a script for the presentation. He’d been telling a version of that same story every single day for months and months during development—to us, to his friends, his family. He was constantly working on it, refining it. Every time he’d get a puzzled look or a request for clarification from his unwitting early audience, he’d sand it down, tweak it slightly, until it was perfectly polished.

- And it all starts with “why.” Why does this thing need to exist? Why does it matter? Why will people need it? Why will they love it? To find that “why,” you need to understand the core of the problem you’re trying to solve, the real issue your customers face on a regular basis.

- There’s a competition for market share and a competition for mind share. If your competitors are telling better stories than you, if they’re playing the game and you’re not, then it doesn’t matter if their product is worse.

Even if your customer knows you and your product, or they’re highly technical, there are frictions that you can eliminate for them.

- A good story is an act of empathy. It recognizes the needs of its audience. And it blends facts and feelings so the customer gets enough of both. First you need enough insights and concrete information that your argument doesn’t feel too floaty and insubstantial. It doesn’t have to be definitive data, but there has to be enough to feel meaty, to convince people that you’re anchored in real facts. But you can overdo it—if your story is only informational, then it’s entirely possible that people will agree with you but decide it’s not compelling enough to act on just yet. Maybe next month. Maybe next year. So you have to appeal to their emotions—connect with something they care about. Their worries, their fears. Or show them a compelling vision of the future: give a human example. Walk through how a real person will experience this product—their day, their family, their work, the change they’ll experience. Just don’t lean so far into the emotional connection that what you’re arguing for feels novel, but not necessary.

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Facts + emotions. Play on both so that people agree rationally and emotionally with you, so that they feel logically justified and emotionally compelled to use your product. 
      Think Steve Jobs’ iPhone announcement. He speaks informationally about what the iPhone does better than its peers, but he also plays on emotions by describing the frustrating FEELINGS of using the then current crop of smartphones. The key is he doesn’t just provide information on their limitations, he elicits feelings related to those limitations
- analogies can be such a useful tool in storytelling. They create a shorthand for complicated concepts—a bridge directly to a common experience. ([Location 1655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1655))

- If you’re disrupting big, entrenched industries, your competition will almost certainly dismiss you in the beginning. They’ll say that what you’re making is a plaything, not a threat. They’ll flat out laugh in your face. ([Location 1711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1711))

- If your company is disruptive, you have to be prepared for strong reactions and stronger emotions. Some people will absolutely love what you’ve made. Some people will violently, relentlessly hate it. That’s the danger with disruption. It is not welcome by everyone. Disruption makes enemies.

- But that’s the tricky thing with disruptions—they’re an extremely delicate balancing act. When they fall apart it’s usually for one of three reasons: You focus on making one amazing thing but forget that it has to be part of a single, fluid experience. [See also: Figure 3.1.1, in Chapter 3.1.] So you ignore the million little details that aren’t as exciting to build—especially for V1—and end up with a neat little demo that doesn’t actually fit into anyone’s life. Conversely, you start with a disruptive vision but set it aside because the technology is too difficult or too costly or doesn’t work well enough. So you execute beautifully on everything else but the one thing that would have differentiated your product withers away. Or you change too many things too fast and regular people can’t recognize or understand what you’ve made. That’s one of the (many) issues that befell Google Glass. The look, the technology—it was all so new that people had no idea what to do with it. There was no intuitive understanding of what the thing was for. It’s as if Tesla decided out the gate to build electric cars with five wheels and two steering wheels. You can change the motor, change the dash—but it still has to look like a car. You can’t push people too far outside their mental model. Not at first. ([Location 1742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=1742))

- To maintain the core of your product there are usually one or two things that have to stay still while everything else spins and changes around them. And that’s a useful constraint.

When you’re handcuffed to a hard deadline, you can’t keep trying this and that, changing your mind, putting the finishing touches on something that will never be finished. When you handcuff yourself to a deadline—ideally an external, immovable date like Christmas or a big conference—you have to execute and get creative to finish on time.

- After you’ve launched your V1, then two to four times in that year, you should be announcing something to the world. New products, new features, new redesigns or updates. Something meaty that’s worth people’s attention. It doesn’t matter if you’re a big or tiny company; if you’re building hardware or apps, B2B or B2C, this is the right rhythm for customers. For humans. Any more announcements or big changes and you’ll start confusing people, any fewer and they’ll start forgetting about you.

It always takes longer than you think to find product/market fit, to get your customers’ attention, to build a complete solution, and then to make money. You typically need to create at least three generations of any new, disruptive product before you get it right and turn a profit. This is true for B2B and B2C, for companies that build with atoms or electrons or both, for brand-new startups and brand-new products.

The “why” drives the “what.” [See also: Chapter 3.2: Why Storytelling.] 2. It solves a problem that a lot of people have in their daily lives. 3. It follows you around.

- I needed to calm down. I needed to find space. I needed to prioritize. Everyone thought I was crazy—and many still do—but here’s what I did: I took several sheets of paper with me everywhere. They had all the top milestones in front of us for each of the disciplines—engineering, HR, finance, legal, marketing, facilities, etc.—and everything we needed to do to reach those milestones. Every top-level question that I had was on those papers. So when I was in a meeting or talking to someone, I could quickly scan it. What are my top issues? What issues do our customers have? What’s the current roadblock for this person’s team? What are the next major milestones? What date commitments did our teams make? And then there was the best part—the ideas. Whenever someone had a great idea that we had to table for the moment—an improvement to the product or the organization—I’d write it down. So right next to the list of that week’s to-dos and tasks, there was a working library of all the things we couldn’t wait to begin. I’d regularly read them to myself and see if they still applied. It kept me inspired and excited and focused on the future. And it was great for the team. They saw that I paid attention to their ideas and made sure we kept thinking about them.

- Nobody works in a vacuum. Everybody has internal customers—people they need to deliver to. App designers, for example, create designs for engineers to implement.

- That was the system we had at Nest. We called it the Three Crowns. Here’s how it worked: Crown 1 was the hiring manager. They got the role approved and found the candidates. Crowns 2 and 3 were managers of the candidate’s internal customers. They picked one or two people from their team to interview the candidate. Feedback was collected, shared, and discussed, then the Three Crowns met to decide who to hire. Matt or I would watch over it all and make the final call in the rare instance when the Crowns couldn’t agree. Typically the answer if we had to get involved was no, thank you: PASS.

- Another good interview technique is to simulate work—instead of asking them how they work, just work with them. Pick a problem and try to solve it together. Choose a subject that both of you are familiar with but neither is an expert in—if you pick a problem in their domain they’ll always sound smart; pick a problem in yours and you’ll always know better. But the subject doesn’t matter nearly as much as the process of watching them think. Get on the whiteboard, draw it out. What kinds of questions do they ask? What approaches do they suggest? Do they ask about the customer? Do they seem empathetic or oblivious? ([Location 3328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=3328))

- At many companies I’ve seen HR topics left to the end of team meetings, or lumped into a separate HR or recruiting meeting. But your priority is your team, its health and growth. The best way to show that is to make it the first agenda item each and every week. Every Monday morning at Nest, that’s how my management meetings started: Who are the great people we want to hire? Are we making our hiring goals or retention metrics? If not, what’s the problem? What are the roadblocks? And how is the team doing? What issues do people have? How are performance reviews going? Who needs a bonus? How are we going to celebrate these accomplishments so the team feels valued? And, most importantly, are people leaving? Why? How are we going to make this job more meaningful and fulfilling and exciting than anything else out there? How are we going to help our people grow? Only after we got through this important subject could we move on to anything else—like what the hell we were building.

Then roles and responsibilities overlap, there’s a ton of redundancy in the upper levels, they have to invent weird new titles for people, and nobody knows what they should be working on.

And you have to notice the problem in the first place. ([Location 3759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09BNJ6GBV&location=3759))

- The people who notice the problems around them—and then dream up solutions—are mostly inventors, startup founders, and kids. Young people look at the world and question it. They’re not worn down by doing the same stupid thing a thousand times—they don’t assume everything has to be the way it is. They ask “why?” Keeping your brain young is key. Seeing problems that are glossed over by others is useful. Coming up with solutions to those problems, using the vocabulary and thought process of a designer, is invaluable.

- Most tech companies break out product management and product marketing into two separate roles: Product management defines the product and gets it built. Product marketing writes the messaging—the facts you want to communicate to customers—and gets the product sold. But from my experience that’s a grievous mistake. Those are, and should always be, one job. There should be no separation between what the product will be and how it will be explained—the story has to be utterly cohesive from the beginning.

Good CEOs walk in with a presentation of where the company was, where it is now, and where it’s headed this quarter and in the years to come.

- If you want to give employees a perk, keep in mind two things: When people pay for something, they value it. If something is free, it is literally worthless. So if employees get a perk all the time, then it should be subsidized, not free. If something happens only rarely, it’s special. If it happens all the time, the specialness evaporates. So if a perk is only received occasionally, it can be free. But you should make it very clear that this is not going to be a regular occurrence and change up the perk so it’s always a surprise.
