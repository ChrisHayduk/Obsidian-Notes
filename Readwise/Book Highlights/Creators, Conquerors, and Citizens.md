## Highlights
- in the ancient world there was no single place called “Greece” (“Hellas” to the Greeks, then as now). The land that currently makes up the modern country of Greece was occupied by a large number of peoples, living typically in city-states (that is, towns with their surrounding farmland), and other city-states, equally populated by peoples who called themselves “Greeks,” were dotted all the way around the coastlines of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. In the Classical period, there were well over a thousand of these statelets. When the ancient Greeks spoke of “Greece,” they meant the abstract sum of all these communities, but in reality there was no shared homeland, and the citizens of each city-state gave their loyalty primarily to the place where they lived: they were Athenians, rather than Syracusans or Spartans.

- This was a view that was held by generations of scholars, for whom the Archaic age was merely a forerunner of Classical perfection and the Hellenistic era a disappointment after Classical glories, but it is a view that is firmly rejected in this book. All three periods are given equal weight, because they are equally important and exciting stretches of Greek history.
