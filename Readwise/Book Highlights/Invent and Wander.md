## Highlights
- “I have no special talent,” Einstein once said. “I am only passionately curious.” That’s not fully true (he certainly did have special talent), but he was right when he said, “Curiosity is more important than knowledge.” ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=88))

- A second key trait is to love and to connect the arts and sciences. Whenever Steve Jobs launched a new product such as the iPod or iPhone, his presentation ended with street signs that showed an intersection of Liberal Arts Street and Technology Street. “It’s in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough,” he said at one of these presentations. “We believe that it’s technology married with the humanities that yields us the result that makes our heart sing.” ([Location 90](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=90))

- Einstein, likewise, realized how important it is to interweave the arts and the sciences. When he felt stymied in his quest for the theory of general relativity, he would pull out his violin and play Mozart, saying that the music helped connect him to the harmony of the spheres.

- Another characteristic of truly innovative and creative people is that they have a reality-distortion field, a phrase that was used about Steve Jobs and comes from a Star Trek episode in which aliens create an entire new world through sheer mental force. When his colleagues protested that one of Jobs’s ideas or proposals would be impossible to implement, he would use a trick he learned from a guru in India: he would stare at them without blinking and say, “Don’t be afraid. You can do it.” ([Location 103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=103))

- That trifecta—humanities, technology, business—is what has made him one of our era’s most successful and influential innovators. ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=126))

- Jeff was a voracious reader with an adventurous mind. His grandfather would take him to the library, which had a huge collection of science fiction books. Over the summers Jeff worked his way through the shelves, reading hundreds of them. Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein became his favorites, and later in life he would not only quote them but also occasionally invoke their rules, lessons, and lingo. ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=144))

- “That was the very moment when I realized I was never going to be a great theoretical physicist,” Bezos says. “I saw the writing on the wall, and I changed my major very quickly to electrical engineering and computer science.” It was a difficult realization. His heart had been set on becoming a physicist, but finally he had confronted his own limits. ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=189))

    - Note: Realism about limitations, playing to one’s strengths
- While working at the hedge fund in 1994, Bezos came across the statistic that the web had been growing by more than 2,300 percent each year. He decided that he wanted to get aboard that rocket, and he came up with the idea of opening a retail store online, sort of a Sears catalogue for the digital age. ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=196))

    - Note: Keep abreast of mega trends growing exponentially
- Realizing that it was prudent to start with one product, he chose books—partly because he liked them and also because they were not perishable, were a commodity, and could be bought from two big wholesale distributors. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=198))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Begin with a focused strategy & niche market, dominate it, then move outwards
- To make the decision, Bezos used a mental exercise that would become a famous part of his risk-calculation process. He called it a “regret minimization framework.” ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=205))

- “You know the business plan won’t survive its first encounters with reality,” he says. “But the discipline of writing the plan forces you to think through some of the issues and to get sort of mentally comfortable in the space. Then you start to understand, if you push on this knob, this will move over here and so on. So, that’s the first step.” ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=212))

- “It formed a culture of customer service in every department of the company,” he says. “Every single person in the company, because we had to work with our hands so close to the customers, making sure those orders went out, really set up a culture that served us well, and that is our goal, to be Earth’s most customer-centric company.” ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=254))

- “Stick with your choice. Jeff Bezos is not in the internet business. He’s in the customer-service business. He will be around for decades to come, well after people have forgotten all the dot.coms that are going to go bust.” ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=270))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Bezos succeeded by keeping his eye on the long game, foregoing profits for growth, and being relentless and sometimes ruthless with competitors and even his own colleagues. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=290))

- The greatest and most serendipitous innovation Bezos made was the creation of Amazon Web Services. The initial ideas—which included a software layer known as Elastic Compute Cloud and a hosting operation known as Simple Storage Service—bubbled up from inside the company. Eventually a variety of related ideas came together in a memo that proposed the creation of a service that would “enable developers and companies to use Web Services to build sophisticated and scalable applications.” ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=308))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The company’s applications developers had been in a constant struggle with the hardware teams, but Bezos made them develop some standard application programming interfaces (APIs) and access to computing resources. “As soon as we did that, it was immediately obvious that every company in the world was going to want this,” he says.

    - Note: Identify problems in your business/life and come up with creative solutions
- The genesis of Amazon Echo was, in one way, like Steve Jobs’s development of Apple iPod. It arose out of intuition rather than focus groups, and it was not in response to some obvious customer demand. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=335))

    - Note: Learn everything you can and have empathy. Then the intuition from knowing what’s possible and understanding people will lead to innovative ideas
- “I’m always trying to figure out one thing first and foremost: Is that person a missionary or a mercenary?” Bezos says. “The mercenaries are trying to flip their stock. The missionaries love their product or their service and love their customers and are trying to build a great service. By the way, the great paradox here is that it’s usually the missionaries who make more money.” ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=344))

- “I want my grandchildren’s grandchildren to be using way more energy per capita than I am,” he says. “And I would like to see us not have a population cap. I wish there were a trillion humans in the solar system; then there would be a thousand Einsteins and a thousand Mozarts.” ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=367))

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Focusing on the long term allows the interests of your customers, who want better and faster services cheaper, and the interests of your shareholders, who want a return on investment, to come into alignment. That’s not always true in the short term. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=408))

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Bezos’s belief in the power of storytelling means that he thinks that his colleagues should be able to create a readable narrative when they pitch an idea. “We don’t do PowerPoint (or any other slide-oriented) presentations at Amazon,” he wrote in a recent shareholder letter. “Instead, we write narratively structured six-page memos. We silently read one at the beginning of each meeting in a kind of study hall.” ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=435))

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- He divides the decisions that have to be made into those that can be walked back and those that are irrevocable. The latter require a lot more caution. In the case of the former, he tries to decentralize the process. At Amazon he created what he calls “multiple paths to yes.” In other organizations, he points out, a proposal can be killed by supervisors at many levels, and it needs to pass through all those gates in order to be approved. At Amazon, employees can shop their ideas around to any of the hundreds of executives who are empowered to get to yes.

We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=565))

- Despite this strong new customer growth, the percentage of orders placed on the Amazon.com website by repeat customers grew from over 58 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997 to over 64 percent in the same period in 1998.

    - Note: Tracking how much customers liked the product
- We’re fortunate to benefit from a business model that is cash-favored and capital efficient. As we do not need to build physical stores or stock those stores with inventory, our centralized distribution model has allowed us to build our business to a billion-dollar sales rate with just $30 million in inventory and $30 million in net plant and equipment.

And we consider them to be loyal to us—right up until the second that someone else offers them a better service.

- Systems capacity: We’ll be expanding our systems capacity to support similar growth levels. The systems group has a significant task: expand to meet near term growth, restructure systems for multi-billion-dollar scale and tens of millions of customers, build out features and systems for new initiatives and new innovations, and increase operational excellence and efficiency. All while keeping a billion-dollar, eight-million-customer store up and available on a 24/7 basis. ([Location 680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=680))

- Only two years ago, Amazon.com’s US book business represented 100 percent of our sales. Today, despite strong growth in US books, other areas account for more than half our sales. Major 1999 initiatives included Auctions, zShops, Toys, Consumer Electronics, Home Improvement, Software, Video Games, Payments, and our wireless initiative, Amazon Anywhere.

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Often, the best way to drive one of these is to deliver the other. For instance, more efficient distribution yields faster delivery times, which in turn lowers contacts per order and customer service costs. These, in turn, improve customer experience and build brand, which in turn decreases customer acquisition and retention costs.

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: The product needs to expand into areas SO RELATED that the experience curve from your initial niche applies, at least in part, to the new area
- In closing, consider this most important point: the current online shopping experience is the worst it will ever be. It’s good enough today to attract seventeen million customers, but it will get so much better. Increased bandwidth will result in faster page views and richer content. Further improvements will lead to “always-on access” (which I expect will be a strong boost to online shopping at home, as opposed to the office) and we’ll see significant growth in non-PC devices and wireless access.

In retrospect, we significantly underestimated how much time would be available to enter these categories and underestimated how difficult it would be for single-category e-commerce companies to achieve the scale necessary to succeed.

    - Note: Opportunities with new technologies last longer than expected and are more difficult to take advantage of than expected
- Online selling (relative to traditional retailing) is a scale business characterized by high fixed costs and relatively low variable costs. This makes it difficult to be a medium-sized e-commerce company. With a long enough financing runway, Pets.com and living.com may have been able to acquire enough customers to achieve the needed scale. But when the capital markets closed the door on financing Internet companies, these companies simply had no choice but to close their doors.

- Price performance of processing power is doubling about every eighteen months (Moore’s Law), price performance of disk space is doubling about every twelve months, and price performance of bandwidth is doubling about every nine months. Given that last doubling rate, Amazon.com will be able to use sixty times as much bandwidth per customer five years from now while holding our bandwidth cost per customer constant. Similarly, price performance improvements in disk space and processing power will allow us to, for example, do ever more and better real-time personalization of our website.

- Focus on cost improvement makes it possible for us to afford to lower prices, which drives growth. Growth spreads fixed costs across more sales, reducing cost per unit, which makes possible more price reductions. Customers like this, and it’s good for shareholders. Please expect us to repeat this loop. ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=869))

Eliminating the root causes of errors saves us money and saves customers time. ([Location 901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=901))

- Why focus on cash flows? Because a share of stock is a share of a company’s future cash flows, and, as a result, cash flows more than any other single variable seem to do the best job of explaining a company’s stock price over the long term.

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- It’s not easy, but you can make an informed forecast of future cash flows by examining a company’s performance in the past and by looking at factors such as the leverage points and scalability in that company’s model. Estimating the number of shares outstanding in the future requires you to forecast items such as option grants to employees or other potential capital transactions. Ultimately, your determination of cash flow per share will be a strong indicator of the price you might be willing to pay for a share of ownership in any company.

- As I’ve discussed many times before, we are firm believers that the long-term interests of shareholders are tightly linked to the interests of our customers: if we do our jobs right, today’s customers will buy more tomorrow, we’ll add more customers in the process, and it will all add up to more cash flow and more long-term value for our shareholders.

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Traditional retail uses real estate (gets more expensive over time + capability doesn’t change much at all). Amazon used technology (gets cheaper AND more capable over time). 
      So lead over traditional retail grows as the tech grows. Amazon positioned itself to ride the technological wave to success
- Traditional stores face a time-tested trade-off between offering high-touch customer experience on the one hand and the lowest possible prices on the other. How can Amazon.com be trying to do both? The answer is that we transform much of customer experience—such as unmatched selection, extensive product information, personalized recommendations, and other new software features—into largely a fixed expense. With customer experience costs largely fixed (more like a publishing model than a retailing model), our costs as a percentage of sales can shrink rapidly as we grow our business. Moreover, customer experience costs that remain variable—such as the variable portion of fulfillment costs—improve in our model as we reduce defects. Eliminating defects improves costs and leads to better customer experience. ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=945))

- OUR ULTIMATE FINANCIAL measure, and the one we most want to drive over the long-term, is free cash flow per share. Why not focus first and foremost, as many do, on earnings, earnings per share or earnings growth? The simple answer is that earnings don’t directly translate into cash flows, and shares are worth only the present value of their future cash flows, not the present value of their future earnings. Future earnings are a component—but not the only important component—of future cash flow per share. Working capital and capital expenditures are also important, as is future share dilution.

- As our shareholders know, we have made a decision to continuously and significantly lower prices for customers year after year as our efficiency and scale make it possible. This is an example of a very important decision that cannot be made in a math-based way. In fact, when we lower prices, we go against the math that we can do, which always says that the smart move is to raise prices. We have significant data related to price elasticity. With fair accuracy, we can predict that a price reduction of a certain percentage will result in an increase in units sold of a certain percentage. With rare exceptions, the volume increase in the short term is never enough to pay for the price decrease. However, our quantitative understanding of elasticity is short-term. We can estimate what a price reduction will do this week and this quarter. But we cannot numerically estimate the effect that consistently lowering prices will have on our business over five years or ten years or more. Our judgment is that relentlessly returning efficiency improvements and scale economies to customers in the form of lower prices creates a virtuous cycle that leads over the long term to a much larger dollar amount of free cash flow, and thereby to a much more valuable Amazon.com. We’ve made similar judgments around Free Super Saver Shipping and Amazon Prime, both of which are expensive in the short term and—we believe—important and valuable in the long term.

Sellers benefit from one of the most advanced fulfillment networks in the world, easily scaling their businesses to reach millions of customers. And not just any customers—Prime members. FBA products can be eligible for Prime free two-day shipping. Customers benefit from this additional selection—they get even more value out of their Prime membership. And, unsurprisingly, sellers see increased sales when they join FBA.

- Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible—one-way doors—and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that—they are changeable, reversible—they’re two-way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups. As organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making process on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention.* We’ll have to figure out how to fight that tendency.

A builder’s mentality helps us approach big, hard-to-solve opportunities with a humble conviction that success can come through iteration: invent, launch, reinvent, relaunch, start over, rinse, repeat, again and again. They know the path to success is anything but straight. ([Location 2578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=2578))

He took me on a long walk in Central Park, listened carefully to me, and finally said, “That sounds like a really good idea, but it would be an even better idea for someone who didn’t already have a good job.” That logic made some sense to me, and he convinced me to think about it for forty-eight hours before making a final decision. Seen in that light, it really was a difficult choice, but ultimately I decided I had to give it a shot. I didn’t think I’d regret trying and failing. And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all. After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I’m proud of that choice.

I think better. I have more energy. My mood is better. And think about it: As a senior executive, what do you really get paid to do? You get paid to make a small number of high-quality decisions.

When I have a good quarterly conference call with Wall Street, people will stop me and say, “Congratulations on your quarter,” and I say, “Thank you,” but what I’m really thinking is that quarter was baked three years ago. Right now I’m working on a quarter that’s going to reveal itself in 2023 sometime, and that’s what you need to be doing. You need to be thinking two or three years in advance, and if you are, then why do I need to make a hundred decisions today? If I make, like, three good decisions a day, that’s enough, and they should just be as high quality as I can make them. Warren Buffet says he’s good if he makes three good decisions a year, and I really believe that. ([Location 3081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=3081))

- There’s one gift the internet brings newspapers. It destroys almost everything, but it brings one gift, and that is free global distribution. In the old days of paper newspapers, you would need to build printing plants everywhere. Your logistics operations, to have a truly global newspaper or even a really national newspaper, meant super-expensive, heavy-capital-expenditure investments. That’s why so few papers actually became national or global. But today, with the internet, you get that gift of free distribution.

- What can also really speed up decision making, in addition to asking whether a decision involves a one-way or two-way door, is teaching the principle of disagreeing and committing. So you’ve got passionate missionaries, which you need to have. Everybody cares, and if you’re not careful, the decision process can basically become a war of attrition. Whoever has the most stamina will win; eventually the other party, with the opposite opinion, will just capitulate: “Okay, I’m exhausted. We’ll do it your way.” That is the worst decision-making process in the world. It leaves everybody demoralized, and you also get a kind of random result. A much better approach is for the more senior person to escalate to even more senior leaders. Controversial decisions need to be escalated quickly. You can’t let two junior people argue for a year and exhaust themselves. You have to teach those junior people.

So it’s all about practice. ([Location 3638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=3638))

- When you can figure out the things that are going to remain true under almost all circumstances, then you can put energy into them. We know what those things are for New Glenn. It’s cost, reliability, and on-time launches. Each one needs improvement before we can enter the next phase of really going out into the solar system, and I know these things are stable in time. We are not going to have a New Glenn customer come to us in ten years and say, “Jeff, I wish the rocket just, you know, failed a little more often” or “I wish it was more expensive or that you were late on my launch dates.” ([Location 3648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=3648))

- When you get resources from the moon, you can get them into free space at very low cost. It takes twenty-four times less energy to lift a pound off the moon than it does off the Earth. That is a huge lever. ([Location 3666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BCCT6MW&location=3666))

- When I’m eighty and reflecting back, I want to have minimized the number of regrets that I have in my life. And most of our regrets are acts of omission—the things we didn’t try, the paths untraveled. Those are the things that haunt us. And I decided that if I didn’t at least give it my best shot, I was going to regret not trying to participate in this thing called the internet that I thought was going to be a big deal.

- You earn trust slowly, over time, by doing hard things well—delivering on time; offering everyday low prices; making promises and keeping them; making principled decisions, even when they’re unpopular; and giving customers more time to spend with their families by inventing more convenient ways of shopping, reading, and automating their homes.

- When we’re criticized for those choices, we listen and look at ourselves in the mirror. When we think our critics are right, we change. When we make mistakes, we apologize. But when you look in the mirror, assess the criticism, and still believe you’re doing the right thing, no force in the world should be able to move you.
