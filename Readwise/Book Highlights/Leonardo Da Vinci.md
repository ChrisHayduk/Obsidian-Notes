## Highlights
- He would go on to create the two most famous paintings in history, The Last Supper and the Mona Lisa. But in his own mind, he was just as much a man of science and engineering. With a passion that was both playful and obsessive, he pursued innovative studies of anatomy, fossils, birds, the heart, flying machines, optics, botany, geology, water flows, and weaponry. Thus he became the archetype of the Renaissance Man, an inspiration to all who believe that the “infinite works of nature,” as he put it, are woven together in a unity filled with marvelous patterns.

- As he aged, he pursued his scientific inquiries not just to serve his art but out of a joyful instinct to fathom the profound beauties of creation. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=152))

- But even when he was engaged in blue-sky thinking, his science was not a separate endeavor from his art. Together they served his driving passion, which was nothing less than knowing everything there was to know about the world, including how we fit into it.

- “He saw beauty in both art and engineering,” Jobs said, “and his ability to combine them was what made him a genius.”4 ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=170))

- Leonardo had almost no schooling and could barely read Latin or do long division. His genius was of the type we can understand, even take lessons from. It was based on skills we can aspire to improve in ourselves, such as curiosity and intense observation. He had an imagination so excitable that it flirted with the edges of fantasy, which is also something we can try to preserve in ourselves and indulge in our children.

- Vision without execution is hallucination. But I also came to believe that his ability to blur the line between reality and fantasy, just like his sfumato techniques for blurring the lines of a painting, was a key to his creativity. Skill without imagination is barren. Leonardo knew how to marry observation and imagination, which made him history’s consummate innovator.

    - Note: Feed your curiosity. Make it grow and expand. It is what sets you apart, what brings you closer to the ubermensch of Nietzsche - a profound love for and affirmation of life
- My favorite gems in his notebooks are his to-do lists, which sparkle with his curiosity. One of them, dating from the 1490s in Milan, is that day’s list of things he wants to learn. “The measurement of Milan and its suburbs,” is the first entry. This has a practical purpose, as revealed by an item later in the list: “Draw Milan.” Others show him relentlessly seeking out people whose brains he could pick: “Get the master of arithmetic to show you how to square a triangle. . . . Ask Giannino the Bombardier about how the tower of Ferrara is walled. . . . Ask Benedetto Protinari by what means they walk on ice in Flanders. . . . Get a master of hydraulics to tell you how to repair a lock, canal and mill in the Lombard manner. . . . Get the measurement of the sun promised me by Maestro Giovanni Francese, the Frenchman.”7 He is insatiable. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=198))

    - Note: Find ALL the sources. For all your curiosities. Devour them. Books, conversations, interviews, etc
- But I did learn from Leonardo how a desire to marvel about the world that we encounter each day can make each moment of our lives richer. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=235))

- Many of these early accounts mention Leonardo’s looks and personality. He is described as a man of eye-catching beauty and grace. He had flowing golden curls, a muscular build, remarkable physical strength, and an elegance of bearing when he was walking through town in his colorful garb or riding on a horse. “Beautiful in person and aspect, Leonardo was well-proportioned and graceful,” according to the Anonimo. In addition, he was a charming conversationalist and a lover of nature, renowned for being sweet and gentle to both people and animals.

    - Note: The ubermensch is physically fit and powerful, kind due to an assuredness and happiness with oneself, inquisitive about nature
- His ability to combine art, science, technology, the humanities, and imagination remains an enduring recipe for creativity. So, too, was his ease at being a bit of a misfit: illegitimate, gay, vegetarian, left-handed, easily distracted, and at times heretical. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=274))

- Above all, Leonardo’s relentless curiosity and experimentation should remind us of the importance of instilling, in both ourselves and our children, not just received knowledge but a willingness to question it—to be imaginative and, like talented misfits and rebels in any era, to think different. ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=276))

- He would have made a poor notary: he got bored and distracted too easily, especially when a project became routine rather than creative.14 ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=377))

    - Note: Allow your curiosity to run your wild. Your desire to jump between topics can be a strength rather than a weakness
- as he dubbed himself with some irony. But he also took pride that his lack of formal schooling led him to be a disciple of experience and experiment. “Leonardo da Vinci, disscepolo della sperientia,”16 he once signed himself. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=382))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Learning from practice and experience rather than reading
- His lack of reverence for authority and his willingness to challenge received wisdom would lead him to craft an empirical approach for understanding nature that foreshadowed the scientific method developed more than a century later by Bacon and Galileo. His method was rooted in experiment, curiosity, and the ability to marvel at phenomena that the rest of us rarely pause to ponder after we’ve outgrown our wonder years.

- “First I shall do some experiments before I proceed further,” he announced, “because my intention is to consult experience first and then with reasoning show why such experience is bound to operate in such a way.” ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=398))

- And it does not take a Freud to understand that sexual drives can be sublimated into ambition and other passions. Leonardo said so himself. “Intellectual passion drives out sensuality,” he wrote in one of his notebooks.24 ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=431))

- Suddenly there arose in me two contrary emotions, fear and desire—fear of the threatening dark cave, desire to see whether there were any marvelous thing within.”25 ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=437))

- Alberti was a major influence nonetheless. Leonardo studied his treatises and consciously tried to emulate both his writing and his demeanor. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=595))

- The project, which he would still refer to decades later in his notebook, ingrained in him a sense of the interplay between artistry and engineering; ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=709))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Art and engineering (even software engineering) are two sides of the same coin
- The glory of being an artist, he realized, was that reality should inform but not constrain. ([Location 860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=860))

- Other artists had drawn landscapes as backdrops, but Leonardo was doing something different: depicting nature for its own sake. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=864))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Love of and appreciation for nature
- Alberti in his treatise on painting had advised that lines should be drawn to delineate edges, and Verrocchio did just that. Leonardo took care to observe the real world, and he noticed the opposite: when we look at three-dimensional objects, we don’t see sharp lines. ([Location 941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=941))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Using real, unbiased observation of the natural, REAL world to overturn dogma
- He was twenty-four, and most former apprentices would have flown their master’s nest by then. But Leonardo was not only still living with his teacher but was producing Madonnas so lacking in distinctiveness that it is hard to tell whether they were painted by him or someone else in the workshop. ([Location 1217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=1217))

    - Note: Two takeaways: 1. Develop a very close relationship with a mentor and spend lots of time learning with them 2. Creativity can take time to develop
- His father was clearly worried, like the parents of many twentysomethings over the ages, about his talented child’s work habits. The monks were as well. The elaborate contract was designed to force Leonardo, already known for leaving paintings unfinished, to buckle down and produce a completed work. ([Location 1237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=1237))

- Despite his disdain, Leonardo closely studied Botticelli’s versions of the Adoration of the Magi and adopted some of his ideas.23 But then he set out to make one that, unlike Botticelli’s, was filled with energy, emotion, agitation, and messiness.

    - Note: Learn from peers and improve on their work. Don’t just accept it uncritically - analyze its weaknesses and do better
- It is a remarkable combination of optical science and imaginative art, and it shows how he constructed his art on a scaffold of science. ([Location 1281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=1281))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Combine imagination with logic
- As Leonardo later wrote in his notebook, “Do not repeat the same movements in the same figure, be it limbs, hands or fingers, nor should the same pose be repeated in one narrative painting.” ([Location 1320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=1320))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Extreme attention to detail, down to the finger. No copy and pasting to make things go faster. Each small detail gets extreme care to bring it to life
- One possible reason is that the task he undertook became overwhelming for a perfectionist. As Vasari explained about Leonardo’s unfinished works, he was stymied because his conceptions were “so subtle and so marvelous” that they were impossible to execute faultlessly. ([Location 1329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=1329))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- He was intent on making sure each one reacted emotionally to the others so that the painting would feel like a coherent narrative and not a random assortment of isolated characters. ([Location 1337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=1337))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Everything gets extreme attention to detail. Everything must fit together into a larger cohesive narrative as well. Make sure each individual piece is perfect and that each piece fits together to form the larger vision as well
- There was another reason, one even more fundamental, that Leonardo did not complete the painting: he preferred the conception to the execution. As his father and others knew when they drew up the strict contract for his commission, Leonardo at twenty-nine was more easily distracted by the future than he was focused on the present. He was a genius undisciplined by diligence. ([Location 1348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=1348))

- Leonardo was pioneering a new style that treated narrative paintings and even portraits as psychological expositions. ([Location 1414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=1414))

- He sought to portray not only moti corporali, the motions of the body, but also how they related to what he called “atti e moti mentali,” the attitudes and motions of the mind.41 More important, he was a master at connecting the two.

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Connection of body and mind. Combining the spiritual and the natural
- “The good painter has to paint two principal things, man and the intention of his mind,” he wrote. “The first is easy and the second is difficult, because the latter has to be represented through gestures and movements of the limbs.”44 He expanded on this concept in a long passage in his notes for his planned treatise on painting: “The movement which is depicted must be appropriate to the mental state of the figure. The motions and postures of figures should display the true mental state of the originator of these motions, in such a way they can mean nothing else. Movements should announce the motions of the mind.” ([Location 1427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=1427))

- On the same sheet is a transcription from Dante’s Inferno: “Put off this sloth,” the master said, “for shame! Sitting on feather-pillows, lying reclined Beneath the blanket is no way to fame— Fame, without which man’s life wastes out of mind, Leaving on earth no more memorial Than foam in water or smoke upon the wind.” 51 ([Location 1451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=1451))

    - Note: 30 years old and yet not at the pinnacle. Keep grinding, success will come in due time
- Unlike Florence, Milan was not well-stocked with master artists. That made it more fertile territory for Leonardo. Because he was an aspiring polymath, he also enjoyed that Milan was filled with scholars and intellectuals in a wide variety of fields, partly due to the esteemed university in nearby Pavia, which was officially founded in 1361 but had roots stretching back to 825. It boasted some of Europe’s best lawyers, philosophers, medical researchers, and mathematicians. ([Location 1523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=1523))

    - Note: NYC? Less developer completion than SF, plenty of VC funding, diverse industries and talents, elite schools (Columbia and NYU). Maybe applies to Boston/Cambridge too
- Leonardo mentioned none of his paintings. Nor did he refer to the talent that ostensibly caused him to be sent to Milan: an ability to design and play musical instruments. What he mainly pitched was a pretense of military engineering expertise. Partly this was to appeal to Ludovico, whose Sforza dynasty had taken power by force and was faced with the constant threat of a local revolt or French invasion. In addition, Leonardo cast himself as an engineer because he was going through one of his regular bouts of being bored or blocked by the prospect of picking up a brush. As his mood swung between melancholy and exultation, he fantasized and boasted about being an accomplished weapons designer.

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Combination of practicality and wanting to learn/try new things. Similar to you?
- The spread of printing presses helped Leonardo pursue additional military ideas after he arrived in Milan. He borrowed some of his concepts from a book by the thirteenth-century scientist Roger Bacon that had a list of ingenious weapons, including “carts and wagons that could move without animal power; devices used to walk on water and to move underneath the water, and contrivances capable of putting man in flight, having a person placed in the center of a mechanical device with artificial wings.”10 Leonardo embellished on all of these ideas.

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Read widely and iterate on good ideas. What seems like novel creativity many times is just knowing and combining more ideas than anyone else
- He did not focus on marginal improvements in engineering and design. Instead, on multiple pages composed in 1487, he proposed a radical concept, one that combined his artistic sensibilities with his visions as an urban engineer: the creation of entirely new “ideal cities” planned for health and beauty. ([Location 1665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=1665))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Looking for revolutionary ideas rather than incremental improvements
- As the offspring of a long line of notaries, Leonardo da Vinci had an instinct for keeping records. Jotting down observations, lists, ideas, and sketches came naturally. In the early 1480s, shortly after his arrival in Milan, he began his lifelong practice of keeping notebooks on a regular basis. Some of them began as loose sheets the size of a tabloid newspaper. Others were little volumes bound in leather or vellum, the size of a paperback or even smaller, which he carried around to make field notes. ([Location 1696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=1696))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: USE YOUR NOTEBOOKS AGAIN. Write down ideas and observations and act on them
- “As you go about town,” he wrote in one of them, “constantly observe, note, and consider the circumstances and behavior of men as they talk and quarrel, or laugh, or come to blows.” ([Location 1701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=1701))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Observe the world in an unbiased manner. Use it to learn the way REALITY is
- When Leonardo wished to paint a figure, he first considered what social standing and emotion it was to represent; whether noble or plebeian, joyful or severe, troubled or serene, old or young, irate or quiet, good or evil; and when he had made up his mind, he went to places where he knew that people of that kind assembled and observed their faces, their manners, dresses, and gestures; and when he found what fitted his purpose, he noted it in a little book which he was always carrying in his belt.2 ([Location 1704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=1704))

- Later notebooks show Leonardo pursuing curiosity for its own sake, and that in turn evolved into glimmerings of profound scientific inquiry. He became interested not only in how things work but why.6 ([Location 1736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=1736))

- the joy of these juxtapositions is that they allow us to marvel at the beauty of a universal mind as it wanders exuberantly in free-range fashion over the arts and sciences and, by doing so, senses the connections in our cosmos. We can extract from his pages, as he did from nature’s, the patterns that underlie things that at first appear disconnected.

- Just below the old man are the trunk and branches of a leafless tree, which blend into his toga and suggest the aorta and arteries of his blood system. Leonardo believed that analogy was a way to appreciate the unity of nature, and among the analogous forms he explored was the branching pattern that could be found in trees, in the arteries of the human body, and in rivers and their tributaries.

- What Leonardo probably began as four distinct elements ended up woven together in a way that illustrates a fundamental theme in his art and science: the interconnectedness of nature, the unity of its patterns, and the analogy between the workings of the human body and those of the earth.

    - Note: Come back to topics often to refine your understanding and update your mental models
- From our vantage centuries later, the time and creativity Leonardo applied to such ephemeral affairs seem wasted. There is nothing to show for the dazzling displays except snippets of reports that recount the fleeting moments of splendor. The time he spent could have been more usefully applied, it might seem, to finishing the Adoration of the Magi or Saint Jerome. But just as today we love halftime shows and Broadway extravaganzas, fireworks displays and choreographed performances, the events staged by the Sforza court were considered vital, and their producers, including Leonardo, were highly valued.

- There are no musical compositions in his notebooks. Rather than reading music or composing lyrics, he improvised when performing at the Sforza court. “Since by nature he possessed a lofty and graceful spirit,” Vasari explained, “he sang divinely, improvising his own accompaniment on the lyre.” ([Location 1866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=1866))

- “Leonardo’s instruments are not merely diverting devices for performing magic tricks,” according to Emanuel Winternitz, a curator of musical instruments at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. “Instead, they are systematic efforts by Leonardo to realize some basic aims.”14 These include new ways to use keyboards, play faster, and increase the range of available tones and sounds.

- In notes for his treatise on painting, Leonardo recommended to young artists this practice of walking around town, finding people to use as models, and recording the most interesting ones in a portable notebook: “Take a note of them with slight strokes in a little book which you should always carry with you,” he wrote. “The positions of the people are so infinite that the memory is incapable of retaining them, which is why you should keep these sketches as your guides.” ([Location 1948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=1948))

- At least since the time of Aristotle, who declared, “It is possible to infer character from features,”24 people had tried to find ways to assess people’s innate personality from their head shapes and facial characteristics, a study known as physiognomy.

- even though he did not consider physiognomy a science, he did believe that facial expressions indicate underlying causes. “Characteristics of the face partly reveal the character of men, their vices and temperaments,” he wrote. “If the features which separate the cheeks from the lips, or the nostrils from the cavities of the eyes, are strongly pronounced, they belong to cheerful and good-humored men.” Those without such distinctive lines are more contemplative, he added, and those “whose facial features stand out in great relief are brutal, bad-tempered, and men of little reason.” He went on to associate heavy lines between the eyebrows with bad temper, strong lines on the forehead with regrets, and concluded, “It is possible to discuss many features this way.”25 ([Location 1962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=1962))

- The stare of Vitruvian Man is as intense as someone looking in a mirror, perhaps literally. According to Toby Lester, who wrote a book about the drawing, “It’s an idealized self-portrait in which Leonardo, stripped down to his essence, takes his own measure, and in doing so embodies a timeless human hope: that we just might have the power of mind to figure out how we fit into the grand scheme of things. Think of the picture as an act of speculation, a kind of metaphysical self-portrait in which Leonardo—as an artist, a natural philosopher, and a stand-in for all of humanity—peers at himself with furrowed brow and tries to grasp the secrets of his own nature.”25 ([Location 2434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=2434))

A testament to his universal interests, they included books on military machinery, agriculture, music, surgery, health, Aristotelian science, Arabian physics, palmistry, and the lives of famous philosophers, as well as the poetry of Ovid and Petrarch, the fables of Aesop, some collections of bawdy doggerels and burlesques, and a fourteenth-century operetta from which he drew part of his bestiary. By 1504 he would be able to list seventy more books, including forty works of science, close to fifty of poetry and literature, ten on art and architecture, eight on religion, and three on math.4 ([Location 2624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=2624))

- He preferred to induce from experiments rather than deduce from theoretical principles. “My intention is to consult experience first, and then with reasoning show why such experience is bound to operate in such a way,” he wrote. In other words, he would try to look at facts and from them figure out the patterns and natural forces that caused those things to happen. “Although nature begins with the cause and ends with the experience, we must follow the opposite course, namely begin with the experience, and by means of it investigate the cause.” ([Location 2645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=2645))

- In lieu of possessing abstract mathematical tools to extract theoretical laws from nature, the way Copernicus and Galileo and Newton later did, Leonardo relied on a more rudimentary method: he was able to see patterns in nature, and he theorized by making analogies. With his keen observational skills across multiple disciplines, he discerned recurring themes. As the philosopher Michel Foucault noted, the “protoscience” of Leonardo’s era was based on similarities and analogies.

- Because of his intuitive feel for the unity of nature, his mind and eye and pen darted across disciplines, sensing connections. “This constant search for basic, rhyming, organic form meant that when he looked at a heart blossoming into its network of veins he saw, and sketched alongside it, a seed germinating into shoots,” Adam Gopnik wrote. “Studying the curls on a beautiful woman’s head he thought in terms of the swirling motion of a turbulent flow of water.”14 His drawing of a fetus in a womb hints at the similarity to a seed in a shell.

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The connections that Leonardo made across disciplines served as guides for his inquiries. The analogy between water eddies and air turbulence, for example, provided a framework for studying the flight of birds. “To arrive at knowledge of the motions of birds in the air,” he wrote, “it is first necessary to acquire knowledge of the winds, which we will prove by the motions of water.”18 But the patterns he discerned were more than just useful study guides. He regarded them as revelations of essential truths, manifestations of the beautiful unity of nature. ([Location 2724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=2724))

- In addition to his instinct for discerning patterns across disciplines, Leonardo honed two other traits that aided his scientific pursuits: an omnivorous curiosity, which bordered on the fanatical, and an acute power of observation, which was eerily intense.

    - Tags: [[pink]] 
    - Note: Combine vast knowledge with intense observation
- The acuteness of his observational skill was not some superpower he possessed. Instead, it was a product of his own effort. That’s important, because it means that we can, if we wish, not just marvel at him but try to learn from him by pushing ourselves to look at things more curiously and intensely. In his notebook, he described his method—almost like a trick—for closely observing a scene or object: look carefully and separately at each detail. He compared it to looking at the page of a book, which is meaningless when taken in as a whole and instead needs to be looked at word by word. Deep observation must be done in steps: “If you wish to have a sound knowledge of the forms of objects, begin with the details of them, and do not go on to the second step until you have the first well fixed in memory.”23 ([Location 2746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=2746))

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Be extremely observant and studious
- Leonardo had a strategy he used to refine his observational skills. He would write down marching orders to himself, determining how he would sequence his observations in a methodical step-by-step way. “First define the motion of the wind and then describe how the birds steer through it with only the simple balancing of the wings and tail,” he wrote in one example. “Do this after the description of their anatomy.” ([Location 2811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=2811))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Observation can and should be planned. If you go into a situation knowing WHAT you want to know and HOW you intend to find it out, you’re much more likely to learn what you’re looking for. Just taking a shotgun approach to learning will have much lower efficiency
- But for all the beauty of his art and all the ingenuity of his designs, he was never able to create a human-powered flying machine that could take off on its own. ([Location 2902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=2902))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Make sure you develop the engineering prowess to support your creativity
- Leonardo’s interest in machinery was linked to his fascination with motion. He saw both machines and humans as apparatuses designed to move, with analogous components such as cords and sinews. As he did with his anatomy drawings of dissected bodies, he drew machines disassembled—using exploded and layered views—to show how motion is transferred from gears and levers to wheels and pulleys, and his cross-disciplinary interests allowed him to connect concepts from anatomy to engineering.

- He could envision the shapes in his head as real objects, then convey them on the page. But he probably also used actual wooden models that he hung on a string, like the dangling polyhedron in the portrait of Pacioli.

- Leonardo’s interest in harmonic ratios was reflected in his intense studies of the ways that ratios and proportions are manifest in anatomy, science, and art.

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Perfecting even the smallest details
- By exalting the interplay between art and science, Leonardo wove an argument that was integral to understanding his genius: that true creativity involves the ability to combine observation with imagination, thereby blurring the border between reality and fantasy.

- When Leonardo was summoned by the duke, they ended up having a discussion of how creativity occurs. Sometimes it requires going slowly, pausing, even procrastinating. That allows ideas to marinate, Leonardo explained. Intuition needs nurturing. “Men of lofty genius sometimes accomplish the most when they work least,” he told the duke, “for their minds are occupied with their ideas and the perfection of their conceptions, to which they afterwards give form.” ([Location 4154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=4154))

- All told, The Last Supper is a mix of scientific perspective and theatrical license, of intellect and fantasy, worthy of Leonardo. His study of perspective science had not made him rigid or academic as a painter. Instead, it was complemented by the cleverness and ingenuity he had picked up as a stage impresario. Once he knew the rules, he became a master at fudging and distorting them, as if creating perspectival sfumato.

- This inability to ground his fantasies in reality has generally been regarded as one of Leonardo’s major failings. Yet in order to be a true visionary, one has to be willing to overreach and to fail some of the time. Innovation requires a reality distortion field.

    - Note: Even Michelangelo had imposter syndrome
- As he had done in his famous letter to Milan’s previous ruler when he first went there in 1482, Leonardo made a point of noting that he was not merely a painter. “I hope when I come to make machines and other things which will give great pleasure to our Most Christian King.” ([Location 5711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=5711))

    - Note: Leonardo always kept his passions and interest wide. He became a arguably the greatest painter in history (extremely deep in one field), but also became a leading expert in several more (sculpture, stage design, engineering, architecture, anatomy, etc). 
      Model yourself this way. Become the foremost expert for a particular field (ML engineering & deep learning), and also be extremely knowledgeable about your other interests (software engineering, math, graphic design, languages & linguistics, psychology & neuroscience, philosophy, business strategy & entrepreneurship). The combination of best-in-the-world expertise in ML/DL with leading expertise in these other areas will make you unstoppable.
- But there was more to Leonardo’s move than merely a preference for life in Milan. The first time he went there, he did so to recast himself as an engineer, scientist, and inventor. Now, more than twenty-five years later, he was fleeing not only Florence but also life as a public artist, a man defined mainly by his painting. As Isabella d’Este’s agent had reported, “He cannot bear the sight of a paintbrush.” ([Location 5722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=5722))

- One of the things that could have most benefited Leonardo in his career was a partner who would help him follow through and publish his brilliant work. Together he and Marcantonio could have produced a groundbreaking illustrated treatise on anatomy that would have transformed a field still dominated by scholars who mainly regurgitated the notions of the second-century Greek physician Galen. Instead, Leonardo’s anatomy studies became another example of how he was disadvantaged by having few rigorous and disciplined collaborators along the lines of Luca Pacioli, whose text on geometric proportions Leonardo had illustrated.

- Along with his discoveries about heart valves, it was Leonardo’s most important anatomical breakthrough, and it happened because he was a sculptor as well as a scientist. ([Location 5905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=5905))

    - Note: Cross disciplinary thinking leads to unbelievable insights.
- Leonardo’s breakthroughs on heart valves were followed, however, by a failure: not discovering that the blood in the body circulates. His understanding of one-way valves should have made him realize the flaw in the Galenic theory, universally accepted during his time, that the blood is pulsed back and forth by the heart, moving to-and-fro. But Leonardo, somewhat unusually, was blinded by book learning. The “unlettered” man who disdained those who relied on received wisdom and vowed to make experiment his mistress failed to do so in this case.

- He was skillful at discerning how patterns resonate in nature, and the grandest and most encompassing of these analogies, in both his art and his science, was the comparison between the body of man and the body of the earth. “Man is the image of the world,” he wrote.

    - Note: The infinite contained in the particular
- The ancients called man a lesser world, and certainly the use of this name is well bestowed, because his body is an analog for the world. As man has in him bones that support his flesh, the world has its rocks that support the earth. As man has a pool of blood in which the lungs rise and fall in breathing, so the body of the earth has its ocean tide which likewise rises and falls every six hours, as if the world breathed. As the blood veins originate in that pool and spread all over the human body, so likewise the ocean sea fills the body of the earth with infinite springs of water.

- The analogy helped him look at the earth in a pioneering way. Rather than assuming that it had been static since its creation, Leonardo realized that the earth had a dynamic history in which powerful forces caused it to change and mature over the centuries. “We might say that the earth has a vegetative soul,” he declared.7 By regarding the earth as a living organism, he was inspired to explore the way it aged and evolved: how mountains laced with fossils arose from the sea, how rocks became layers, how rivers cut valleys, and how rugged outcroppings eroded.

- As usual, he made an analogy, comparing the forces that create water eddies to those that create a hair curl: “The curling motion of the surface of water resembles the behavior of hair, which has two motions, one of which depends on the weight of the strands, the other on the direction of its revolving; thus water makes eddies, one part of which is due to the impetus of the principal current, and the other is due to the incidental motion and return flow.” ([Location 6262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=6262))

- By the time he wrote the Codex Leicester and other, concurrent notebook pages on the movement of water, Leonardo had a deep feel for how waves propagate in a medium, and he correctly assumed that sound and light travel in waves.

At the core of the narrative in The Last Supper are the waves of emotion that emanate from the disturbance caused by the utterance of Jesus.

- So the world’s most famous smile is inherently and fundamentally elusive, and therein lies Leonardo’s ultimate realization about human nature. His expertise was in depicting the outer manifestation of inner emotions. But here in the Mona Lisa he shows something more important: that we can never fully know true emotion from outer manifestations. There is always a sfumato quality to other people’s emotions, always a veil. ([Location 7051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=7051))

- The Mona Lisa became the most famous painting in the world not just due to hype and happenstance but because viewers were able to feel an emotional engagement with her. She provokes a complex series of psychological reactions, which she herself seems to exhibit as well. Most miraculously, she seems aware—conscious—both of us and of herself. That is what makes her seem alive, the most alive of any portrait ever painted. It is also what makes her unique, one of humankind’s unsurpassed creations. As Vasari said, “It was painted in a way to make every brave artist tremble and lose heart.” ([Location 7082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=7082))

We cannot portray him with crisp sharp lines, nor should we want to, just as he would not have wanted to portray Mona Lisa that way. There is something nice about leaving a little to our imagination.

- One reason that he was reluctant to relinquish some of his works and declare them completed was that he relished a world in flux. He had an uncanny ability to convey movements—of the body and the mind, of machines and horses, and of rivers and everything else that flows. No instant, he wrote, is self-contained, just as no action in a theatrical pageant nor any drop in a flowing river is self-contained. Each moment incorporates what came right before and what is coming right after. Similarly, he looked upon his art and engineering and his treatises as a part of a dynamic process, always receptive to a refinement by the application of a new insight.

- What made Leonardo a genius, what set him apart from people who are merely extraordinarily smart, was creativity, the ability to apply imagination to intellect. His facility for combining observation with fantasy allowed him, like other creative geniuses, to make unexpected leaps that related things seen to things unseen. “Talent hits a target that no one else can hit,” wrote the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. “Genius hits a target no one else can see.” ([Location 7411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=7411))

- What also distinguished Leonardo’s genius was its universal nature. The world has produced other thinkers who were more profound or logical, and many who were more practical, but none who was as creative in so many different fields. Some people are geniuses in a particular arena, such as Mozart in music and Euler in math. But Leonardo’s brilliance spanned multiple disciplines, which gave him a profound feel for nature’s patterns and crosscurrents. His curiosity impelled him to become among the handful of people in history who tried to know all there was to know about everything that could be known.

So even though we may never be able to match his talents, we can learn from him and try to be more like him. His life offers a wealth of lessons.

- Respect facts. Leonardo was a forerunner of the age of observational experiments and critical thinking. When he came up with an idea, he devised an experiment to test it. And when his experience showed that a theory was flawed—such as his belief that the springs within the earth are replenished the same way as blood vessels in humans—he abandoned his theory and sought a new one. This practice became common a century later, during the age of Galileo and Bacon. It has, however, become a bit less prevalent these days. If we want to be more like Leonardo, we have to be fearless about changing our minds based on new information.

- Procrastinate. While painting The Last Supper, Leonardo would sometimes stare at the work for an hour, finally make one small stroke, and then leave. He told Duke Ludovico that creativity requires time for ideas to marinate and intuitions to gel. “Men of lofty genius sometimes accomplish the most when they work least,” he explained, “for their minds are occupied with their ideas and the perfection of their conceptions, to which they afterwards give form.” Most of us don’t need advice to procrastinate; we do it naturally. But procrastinating like Leonardo requires work: it involves gathering all the possible facts and ideas, and only after that allowing the collection to simmer.

- Think visually. Leonardo was not blessed with the ability to formulate math equations or abstractions. So he had to visualize them, which he did with his studies of proportions, his rules of perspective, his method for calculating reflections from concave mirrors, and his ways of changing one shape into another of the same size. Too often, when we learn a formula or a rule—even one so simple as the method for multiplying numbers or mixing a paint color—we no longer visualize how it works. As a result, we lose our appreciation for the underlying beauty of nature’s laws. ([Location 7480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=7480))

- Avoid silos. At the end of many of his product presentations, Jobs displayed a slide of a sign that showed the intersection of “Liberal Arts” and “Technology” streets. He knew that at such crossroads lay creativity. Leonardo had a free-range mind that merrily wandered across all the disciplines of the arts, sciences, engineering, and humanities.

But he did begin one of a silk-merchant’s wife named Lisa. He did it because he wanted to, and he kept working on… ([Location 7494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071Y385Q1&location=7494))
