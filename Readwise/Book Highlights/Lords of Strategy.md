## Highlights
- three Cs central to any good strategy: the company’s costs, especially costs relative to other companies; the definition of the markets the company served—its customers, in other words—and its position vis à vis competitors.

- According to his schema, the first phase of strategy’s history, from its beginnings in the early 1960s until approximately the mid-1980s, was about positioning. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=197))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- In strategy’s second stage, extending from the late 1980s to today, its intellectual focus turned to processes, the procedures and routines by which companies get things done. ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=200))

- Occupying the broader middle ground between these two is a school that maintains that people are the key to innovation, and innovation the modern requisite for competitive success. ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=211))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The tamer, more conventional way of framing this tension is to see the history of strategy as a struggle between two definitions, strategy as positioning and strategy as organizational learning. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=221))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The positioning school, led by Harvard’s Porter, sees strategy making as the choice of where you want to compete, in what industry and from what spot within that industry, and how—on price, with distinctive products, or by finding a niche. ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=222))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The organizational-learning school, by contrast, maintains that no company that’s already up and running can choose its strategy as if it had a blank slate. Almost gleeful in its derision of the positionists—at least its leading spokesman, McGill’s Henry Mintzberg is—the learning school also argues that virtually no strategy ever works as originally planned. The point, they say, is for the company to set off in one direction, learn from the response it gets from markets and competitors, and then adjust accordingly.

- Bruce Henderson was also an elitist. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=249))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- He wanted the smartest of the smart, and to attract them he was prepared to overlook what might have seemed obvious liabilities. Of the first seven professionals at BCG, only one besides Henderson had any consulting experience. ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=252))

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The elitism that Henderson-style strategy making brought with it represents one of the big reasons so many otherwise well-informed businesspeople hate consultants. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=267))

- So, in the latest turn of its wheel, strategy becomes about how to make existing institutions as innovative as start-ups. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=287))

- Henderson spent the next eighteen years at Westinghouse, working in purchasing much of the time, being promoted to corporate vice president in 1953. But for all his long tenure and seeming success, neither the man himself, the written record, nor the recollections of his BCG colleagues have much to say about what he did or learned there. ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=338))

- “Nearly all companies I have known,” he would say in 1985, “have a number of businesses they should not be in.” ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=357))

- Norton thus posed for the consultants the first example of a kind of case they would encounter repeatedly, soon to be classified under the heading market segmentation. Looking at the universe of markets you serve, all the customers to whom you sell different products or services, how do you carve up the totality to figure out where you make money and where not? By customer? Product? Geography? Some combination of the three? (Anyone who asserts “You just take the cost of the product and subtract it from the price” has never worked in a large organization.) ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=404))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The initiatives also marked the beginning of a shift in how consultants were to compete: BCG was going to build its practice around the drawing power of its ideas, not on its storied history or the time-honed expertise of its senior partners. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=422))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The first tool was what became known as BCG Perspectives, short, punchy essays—eight hundred words, typically—on a new idea or a nagging business question, published in a brochure format just the right size for tucking into a coat pocket. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=424))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- In the decades that followed, BCG published over four hundred Perspectives—at the height of popularity, up to fifteen a year—with some partners calculating that the essays eventually reached an audience as large as that of Business Week. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=434))

- Henderson’s sentences are simple, declarative, unadorned, almost deadpan in their calm. “A businessman can predict his normal costs far into the future if he understands their basic relationship to experience.” ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=436))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Even colleagues whom he drove crazy in other ways describe Henderson as a good writer, and he worked at it, revising each Perspectives article ten or fifteen times, polishing his own efforts with professional help. Of the six people on staff at the end of 1964, one was a full-time editor. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=439))

- “Profit from the Learning Curve,” by a professor of chemical engineering, Winfred Hirschmann. As Hirschmann noted, as early as 1925, manufacturers of aircraft had begun to observe that the amount of labor that went into making an aircraft declined predictably as the number of planes manufactured increased. ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=587))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Hirschmann and others concluded that the explanation lay in learning—hence the name learning curve—but learning not just by individuals (the kind of progress that Frederick Taylor would clock on a stopwatch), but rather by the organization as a whole (which was going to put the Greater in Greater Taylorism). ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=596))

- BCG would speak of a company’s or industries’ accumulated “experience.” With each doubling of experience, costs and prices should decline by a predictable amount, typically between 15 and 25 percent. ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=612))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- BCG posited a direct relationship between a company’s position on the experience curve—and hence its costs—and its market share. The competitor with the largest share, the one that sold more of the product than anyone else did, should be the one with the most “experience.” ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=614))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The essential insight here was heartening or terrifying, depending on how your company was situated: the market-share leader should be the low-cost producer in any industry. Provided that it continued to churn out more units than any other competitor and thus drive down the experience curve faster, that company should remain the low-cost producer forever and ever, amen brother.

- The call-to-action message, shocking to many at the time, was that you couldn’t truly understand how you were doing in a business or likely to do unless you understood exactly how you stood vis à vis your competitors.

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- the proportion of U.S. workers who labored in manufacturing peaked in the early 1940s, at 32 percent; today, it’s less than 10 percent, a seeming historical inevitability that ought to be borne in mind by those shocked to discover the migration of “good American jobs” overseas.) ([Location 641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=641))

- The worry at the time was not about how these giants might be buffeted by the forces of competition, but rather that their power was too largely unchecked. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=645))

- Government responded to the threat, or the snub. In 1950, Congress passes the Cellar-Kefauver Act outlawing mergers that reduced or lessened competition “in any line of commerce.” ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=649))

- The philosophical underpinning of his recommendation “was balancing operating risk and financial risk.” If you had a low level of operating risk, as timber companies did, “beef up the financial risk by the use of debt, to get to the appropriate level of debt for the business.” ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=900))

- “It occurred to me that the savings account is the growth business; it automatically compounds, but you get no cash out of it. The bond is your stable market-share business that’s throwing off cash and an equal amount of earnings and maintains its value over time. The mortgage is the business that’s declining, and the way you should manage it is to pull cash out.” ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=958))

- Bain notes that in this period, the late 1960s and early 1970s, the typical BCG assignment lasted perhaps six weeks, culminating in a written report to the client. He became frustrated by the fact that the consultants would hand over the report and then leave, not checking back later to find out if anything came of it. Moreover, in contrast to the corporate planners, the real decision makers seemed to be reading only the executive summaries. He began wondering if the BCG consultants might not be writing up their exquisite reports—rich with surprising insight, supported by terrific data—more with an eye toward impressing colleagues than out of any concern with what the client might do with the findings. ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1242))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The short-term, usually one-off nature of the assignments that BCG did—at least prior to the growth-share matrix—didn’t inherently make for repeat business. Which meant a continuing scramble for new clients and more marketing expenses—more Perspectives to be sent out, more conferences staged. ([Location 1252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1252))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Steve Schaubert, a long-standing Bain partner, puts it this way: “We wanted to get strategy down to the level where somebody with a wrench in his hands could do something about it.” ([Location 1340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1340))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Effectively, Bain was taking the concepts from the early stages of the strategy revolution and figuring out how to turn them into behavior, in ways that BCG, already moving on to look for the next killer construct, was not. ([Location 1344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1344))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Bain & Company would work for only one company in an industry, or, more precisely, in a competitive set, and only if that company agreed to a continuing, probably multiyear relationship. That kind of commitment and open-endedness made it possible for the firm to spend months gathering data and analyzing it. ([Location 1348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1348))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The product of Bain’s efforts was to be not a report or a study—the firm’s consultants still drip with disdain at the mention of such things—but rather a strategy and, even more important, results—results that you could see first on the bottom line, then in the stock price. Fairly quickly, this value proposition was boiled down to a snappy formulation: “We don’t sell advice by the hour; we sell profits at a discount.” ([Location 1352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1352))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Even that focus might be too limiting, though, the consultants gradually concluded. In an era when the boundaries between industries were becoming increasingly porous, why constrain yourself to looking for lessons and insights just in the client’s industry? Might not a retailing company, say, have come up with processes—in distribution, perhaps, or customer service—that a client in manufacturing could emulate to its advantage? The aspiration now became to find the best feasible practices. ([Location 1414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1414))

- Bain was getting so much continuing business from existing clients that its paid-for consultant utilization was more like 90 percent. ([Location 1419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1419))

- The solution they finally hit upon to satisfy their yen was the creation of Bain Capital, a private equity firm, in 1983. Bain Capital would be separate from the consulting firm. It would raise money from investors, including from Bain & Company partners but not limited to them, and buy businesses, which would then be given the complete Bain performance-improvement treatment, including the practice of adding performance-enhancing debt to the capital structure. After the magic had been worked, the businesses would be taken public or sold to another buyer, ideally at a multiple several times what Bain Capital had originally paid for them.

- “The Evolution of Strategic Management” was fostered by recognition on Gluck’s part that planning constituted only one source of strategy. Equally important, he argued, indeed maybe more so, were strategic thinking (“creative, entrepreneurial insights”) and opportunistic decision making (an “effective response to unexpected opportunities and problems”), with all three sources rooted in “market understanding, competitive analysis,” and a grasp of “major environmental trends.” ([Location 1640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1640))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Gluck attributed BCG’s success to its assembly of a cadre of what he called strategy buffs. ([Location 1703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1703))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Whereas McKinsey had emphasized “the situational nature of strategy development”—as in, “It all depends”—its competitors had developed a systematic approach to the subject and had even gone beyond this to actually demonstrate “a capability to execute it.” ([Location 1704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1704))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- To counter the interlopers, Gluck outlined a program with several thrusts. They included, first, “strengthening and expanding our arsenal of concepts, techniques, tools, knowledge, practitioners, and spokesmen primarily through intensive internal development programs.” ([Location 1715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1715))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- As part of building the “knowledge culture,” its consultants began grinding out staff papers—often twenty pages long, based on experience with clients and internal debates, and some suitable for repurposing as Harvard Business Review articles.

- Andrews’s place in this history derives principally from his 1971 summa theologica. Read today—though few do—The Concept of Corporate Strategy stands out mostly as a map of the road, a very high road, not taken by subsequent thinkers on the strategy, including the posse who would later make Harvard Business School the leading source of academic wisdom on the subject. ([Location 1789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1789))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- For Andrews, “corporate strategy is the pattern of major objectives, purposes, or goals and essential plans for achieving those goals, stated in such a way as to define what business the company is in or is to be in and the kind of company it is or is to be.” ([Location 1794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1794))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Andrews also was clear on the proposition that a company’s strategy was, within certain constraints, the product of choices made by its leaders—still a surprisingly novel idea in academic circles of that era. ([Location 1796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1796))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Andrews found that contrary to what contemporary economists would have predicted, different companies in that industry actually had different cost structures and different levels of profitability, mostly because competitors pursued different product and sales strategies. ([Location 1799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1799))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Andrews took pains to describe his conception of strategy as reflecting a general manager’s point of view—in contrast to the economist’s view, which he had little use for. Economists, he argued, failed to take into account the rich variety of issues that such a manager should consider in charting the company’s future, including relating strategy to the needs of society, the environment, and the manager’s personal values, and parsing how “organizational processes and behavior” conduced to “the accomplishment of purpose.” ([Location 1802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1802))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- It was precisely this multidimensionality that Andrews ultimately believed had been abandoned by those who succeeded him in thinking about the subject, including at HBS. “Economists have been harassing my idea of the concept of competitive strategy ever since,” Andrews told me, “in the sense that the human, and the moral, and the ethical dimensions are largely ignored. Michael Porter and that group are working within the concept, but have departed from it—the ethical and moral elements—from sheer lack of interest.” ([Location 1807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1807))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Industrial organization (IO) economics is a world of models that depict the effect of forces, at the highest level all purposed at explaining why competition exists in certain industries but not in others, and hence why some industries are more profitable. ([Location 1851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1851))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- He would take the conceptual apparatus of IO, which was about why certain industries were highly competitive and others not at all, and—to use the expression employed by almost everyone who knows this story—“turn it on its head,” focusing instead on what structural factors created opportunities in an industry that a company could exploit to its competitive advantage. ([Location 1869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1869))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- “That was the radical that I was,” Porter says. “To this day, I completely accept the premise that every company is different, that every company is unique.” But he also thought “there was a framework or structure for thinking about competition from which we can generalize. The radical in me said, ‘Look, we can believe in the core ideas of Chris and Ken, but that doesn’t mean you can’t strive for analytical frameworks that will add horsepower and insight to that quest for this unique strategy.’ That’s what we [meaning ‘I’] set out to do.” ([Location 1873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1873))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- At that stage in IO’s history, he says, the view of industry structure was “overwhelmingly dominated by just two factors: seller concentration [what percentage of the market did the top four or top eight command] and barriers to entry,” of which three or four types were posited, such as scale. ([Location 1878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1878))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- “the essence of formulating competitive strategy is relating a company to its environment,” and that the “key aspect” of that environment was the industry it found itself in and that industry’s structure. ([Location 1887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1887))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The framework posited five factors essential to determining how profitable an industry could be for its players and where and how within it a company might have room to compete. At the center of a diagram of the forces was the competitive rivalry between “firms” (the economists’ term for “companies”) (figure 7-1). Arrayed around this rivalry and helping determine its intensity were the other forces: the bargaining power of suppliers, the bargaining power of buyers, the threat of new entrants, and the threat of substitute offerings.

- “The five forces is a system that’s in motion at all times, and industry, technology, and consumer forces and all these outside forces are always acting on the five. At any point in time, you can use the framework to explain the current profitability of the industry. ([Location 1896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1896))

- Porter admits that he even lectured a bit at the end of some sessions, coming out from behind the Socratic mask. His students ate it up, new-style intellectualization breaking through the primordial, each-case-is-different mist: instead of walking away from class discussion wondering what they were supposed to have learned, they came away with charts, templates, lists that they could apply to the next strategic problem thrown at them. “Tons of takeaways,” as Porter describes them.

- There were essentially three strategies a company could choose, he posited: low-cost leadership (beloved of fans of the experience curve), product differentiation (making your offering so distinctive that you could charge more for it), or market specialization (pick a niche and dominate it).

- The theme that strategy is about choice, that a company must pick a strategy that distinguishes it from its competitors, was to become a constant in Porter’s work over the decades that followed. ([Location 1987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=1987))

- Businesspeople don’t spend a lot of time thinking about such questions but a review of the management literature of the second half of the twentieth century suggests that at least three possibilities contended for their attention. The first chronologically dates from Peter Drucker’s 1946 book Concept of the Corporation, whose title suggests he thought the world needed one.

- the early champions of corporate strategy didn’t write much about sociology or community. Implicit in their thinking was a concept of the company more like that of economists, but less passive, more the master of its own destiny than the pawn of market forces. If the economists posited a sort of corporate version of their famous fiction, homo economicus, the consultants endowed it with certain qualities of an army—always in a fight (competition), led from the top, its sense of itself built around its strategy.

- Probably his most memorable finding was that those organizations didn’t abide by theories of rational decision making. Instead of choosing the path that economists would say leads to the best possible result, they will often pick an option that keeps contending internal factions at peace, “satisficing,” to use the word Simon coined, rather than optimizing.

- Peters found that much of the wisdom McKinsey had on his subject, whether homegrown or borrowed, didn’t go very far, particularly when measured against the Simonian thinking on organizations he’d been steeped in at Stanford. The Firm had built much of its reputation translating into client practice Chandler’s observation that structure follows strategy. Over time, somewhat weirdly but also perhaps inevitably, this morphed into an impression in certain McKinsey minds that in effect, a company’s strategy was its structure.

- Pascale began his article on what he termed “the Honda effect” by noting that “strategy,” while seemingly “an innocent noun,” had come, for “a vast and influential population of executives, planners, academics, and consultants,” to embody “an implicit model of how organizations should be guided.” For these folks, the basis of what he described as “a $500-million-a-year ‘strategy’ industry” in the United States and Europe, the characteristic elements of strategy formulation were that it was “generally assumed to be driven by senior management whom we expect to set the strategic direction,” that it had been “extensively influenced by empirical models and concepts,” and that it was “often associated with a laborious strategic planning process that, in some companies, has produced more paper than insight.” ([Location 2225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=2225))

- WHAT IS A COMPANY FOR? To what end do we create and toil in such entities? Nowadays, for most who give any thought to the matter, the answer seems boringly obvious: the purpose of a corporation is to enrich its owners, usually its shareholders. But in fact, agreement on this point has been arrived at only recently, starting in the 1980s largely as the product of newly discovered opportunities to make money.

- There are two ways of thinking about the objective of strategy. One [coming from those still in search of excellence] is that this company is going to be a great place, and it’s going to produce these great products, and suppliers are going to love dealing with it, and it’s going to spin off economic value, but basically, this is going to be a great and enduring institution.” Foster immediately dismisses this as “a wistful notion”—sweet, sentimental, and completely wrongheaded. “The other approach,” he says, “is, ‘To hell with all that. I just want it to produce money for shareholders. This is capitalism, and in capitalism, the shareholder is at the top of the evolutionary tree, and we should return profits to shareholders.’” ([Location 2919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=2919))

- To their credit, the founding fathers of the resource-based view did try to establish criteria for judging resources on their potential for contributing to strategic advantage. 1 They settled on four criteria, whose first letters gave birth to still another acronym, VRIN. A resource must be valuable, in the sense of adding value by enabling the company to better exploit opportunities or reduce threats. It must be rare—if it’s available to anyone in the industry, it won’t confer much advantage. It must be inimitable; if your advantage is to be sustainable, the resource can’t be something competitors can easily duplicate. Finally, the resource must be nonsubstitutable: barrels of whale oil won’t do you much good when competitors are already filling your customers’ lamps with kerosene.

- Evans is the only thinker I’ve encountered who talks about the ontology of strategy (the philosophy of being it’s premised on) and its epistemology (its theory of the nature of knowledge, in this instance, the knowledge of how to achieve competitive advantage). “Porter took a lens from structuralist economics, but he applied it to, quote unquote, an industry,” Evans argues. “What’s an industry? A small number of largely similar organizations, internally collaborative, externally competitive, that connect to each other through the mechanism of a competitive market, and connect upstream to suppliers, downstream to customers. If structural advantage was the epistemology, the ontology was that picture of who the players are,” namely, companies. “Both Bruce Henderson and Porter subscribed to that set of premises.” ([Location 4289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=4289))

- But strategy evolved. “When capabilities came along,” Evans argues, “that changed the epistemology—it said, ‘No, competitive advantage is not identification of structural differences; it’s the identification of capabilities.’ But the ontology stayed exactly the same—companies competing with one another in an industry.” Perhaps not forever, though. “The deconstruction logic challenges the ontology,” argues Evans. “It says, ‘Wait a second. Who says there’s this thing called “the business,” or “the company,” or “the industry”?’” He then cites a soon-to-be former industry in which he did a lot of consulting: “What’s the media industry, anymore? Blogs? Who are the customers, who are the suppliers?

- “Once you start from the idea that the unit of competitive advantage is not necessarily the corporation, as conventionally defined … it’s like in biology, going from thinking of competition among animals to thinking of competition among genes. The generation of strategic thinking we’re now entering challenges the earlier ontological assumptions. It says that the only irreducible unit in this picture is the person—the customer, worker, or executive. It says that people engage in transactions, broadly defined, that may be competitive, or may be cooperative, but what emerges is a network. As technology drives down the costs of transactions, breaking the constraints of distance or of institutions, those networks become more fluid.” ([Location 4301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=4301))

- While few voiced concern about the matter before the crash, the share of corporate profits in the United States sopped up by banks, investment banks, insurance companies, and other purveyors of financial services had swelled generously in the first years of the twenty-first century. In the early 1980s, the profits they earned accounted for a mere 15 percent of total U.S. corporate profits. In the 1990s, as good times prevailed in the economy, the sector occasionally garnered a 30 percent share of the rising profit pie. By 2007, at the pinnacle of the financial-service firms’ success, their share of U.S. corporate profits amounted to 41 percent of the whole.

Financial institutions appeared to take this message to heart as well.

Marching under matching banners that read “Free markets know best” and “Down with restrictive regulation,” financial firms and their lobbyists steadily chipped away at laws restricting interstate banking or setting limits on what kinds of businesses a bank holding company might be in. Increasingly, Brobdingnagian giants such as Citigroup or Bank of America would end up offering their clients not just banking services but also mutual funds, brokerage, and insurance, all this with an eye toward plumping the institution’s “share of wallet.” ([Location 4481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=4481))

Wanting to spur the recovery, it lowered interest rates from the 6.5 percent that prevailed in May 2000 down to 1.75 percent in December 2001. Housing boomed: prices of existing homes rose, construction abounded, and owners borrowed against their rising asset values and spent the cash.

How about a nice mortgage-backed security, maybe repackaged into a collateralized debt obligation? Or a credit default swap? By 2007, there had grown up a shadow banking system, mostly beyond the regulatory sunshine illuminating the traditional system, with about $60 trillion in assets—at least on paper—some four times the size of the U.S. gross domestic product.

Firms holding securities based on the mortgages failed (Lehman Brothers) or had to be rescued by the government. Stock markets crashed around the world. The enormity of the counterparty risk entailed in AIG’s credit-default business came to light, along with AIG’s inability to pay off on its obligations. Credit markets seized up; even worthy borrowers were unable to get loans. The economies of major nations plunged into recession, or deeper into recessions already under way.

The consultant, Eric Flamholtz, a professor at UCLA’s Anderson School of Management, told how most industries evolved such that one competitor had more than a 40 percent share, the next more than 20 percent, a third competitor 10 percent, and the rest mere boutique status. (One can almost see Bruce Henderson nodding from the great beyond.) This, at a point when Countrywide’s share was about 10 percent and the market share leader’s was no more than 13 percent.

Just about any loan was to be made, provided that the price exacted from borrowers was high enough. Whatever kinds of loans competitors were offering, Countrywide would offer, too. Loan-credit standards, including those for people taking out subprime loans, declined almost to nothingness. ([Location 4537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OC072G&location=4537))

- A consultant who did millions of dollars’ worth of projects on this front tells how the process worked: “We’d go through the list of all the bank’s payables and tag them according to the vendors—this division was paying IBM so much for desktop computers, another paying another part of IBM a lot for mainframes. We’d ask the bank’s chief technology officer if he was sure he was getting the best possible deal, and he’d say Absolutely; IBM guaranteed us we were getting the lowest price available.’ But when you aggregated all that the bank was spending with IBM, it turns out the figure was huge, and armed with that information the bank could negotiate much better prices.” Haven’t we heard this song before, the client not knowing its own costs as well as it needs to, say, from the dawn of the revolution?

- Yes indeed, the length of time a company might expect its competitive advantage to last had steadily declined since the 1960s, reflected in a surge upward in what the consultants not-so-charmingly called “the positional volatility of leaders.” Even while a few corporations were growing to a size larger than many governments, in most businesses, being the biggest was less and less likely to make you the most profitable. With a value-chain analysis in hand, companies were increasingly eager to outsource some of their activities, not just information technology and human resources but also procurement and logistics. And in a particular irony, just as many companies were realizing that people were the key to their future strategic success, they were also discovering that shareholder-value-driven pressures to work longer hours coupled with heightened job insecurity were making employees more likely to feel unmotivated and disenfranchised.
