## Highlights
- The phenomenon of entanglement is the essential fact of quantum mechanics, the fact that makes it so different from classical physics. It brings into question our entire understanding about what is real in the physical world. Our ordinary intuition about physical systems is that if we know everything about a system, that is, everything that can in principle be known, then we know everything about its parts. If we have complete knowledge of the condition of an automobile, then we know everything about its wheels, its engine, its transmission, right down to the screws that hold the upholstery in place. It would not make sense for a mechanic to say, “I know everything about your car but unfortunately I can’t tell you anything about any of its parts.” But that’s exactly what Einstein explained to Bohr—in quantum mechanics, one can know everything about a system and nothing about its individual parts—but Bohr failed to appreciate this fact. I might add that generations of quantum textbooks blithely ignored it. ([Location 64](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FD36G1Q&location=64))
