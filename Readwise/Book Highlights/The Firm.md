## Highlights
- After almost a century in business, McKinsey can lay claim to the following incomplete list of accomplishments: Once before, well before Romney was running for the presidency, it remapped the power structure within the White House; it guided postwar Europe through a massive corporate reorganization; it helped invent the bar code; it revolutionized business schools; it even created the idea of budgeting as a management tool.

- The abstract, white-collar nature of modern business—the fact that the greatest value in our economy is now created by people sitting in air-conditioned skyscrapers and corporate parks who manipulate information—is a reality that McKinsey was instrumental in establishing, championing, and profiting from.

- At the same time, however, the company can also be saddled with a list of striking failures, missteps that would have doomed lesser firms. McKinsey consultants were on the scene when General Motors drove itself into the ground. They were Kmart’s advisers when the retailer tumbled into disarray. They pushed Swissair in a direction that led to its collapse. They played a critical role in building the bomb known as Enron and collected massive fees right up until the moment of its spectacular explosion.

- What do they actually do? They are managerial experts, cost cutters, scapegoats, and catalysts for corporate change. They are the businessman’s businessmen. They are the corporate Mandarin elite, a private corps, far from prying eyes, doing behind-the-scenes work for the most powerful people in the world.

- Plenty of other firms had the same idea at the same time, some even earlier, but none could match Bower’s discipline and focus. He distinguished McKinsey not just for what it did but for how it went about it, starting with the physical appearance of its employees and moving right on through hiring, training, and the culling of their ranks through a merciless system known as “up-or-out.” ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=68))

- McKinsey can nevertheless claim a remarkable number of firsts: It was the first consulting firm to realistically apply scientific approaches to management, solving business problems with a method of hypothesis, data, and proof. It was the first to gamble on youth over experience, and the first to take on the challenge of becoming truly global.

- In a word, McKinsey sells its own enlightenment, the firm’s ability to see things more clearly than its clients. Doing that once is no great accomplishment—a fresh perspective is the way out of many problems, in business or otherwise. Doing it for nearly a century is a tall order indeed, but it is one that McKinsey has apparently met. ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=144))

- the man knew accounting could be more than mere bookkeeping—that numbers could reveal not just profit and loss, assets and liabilities, but the whole story of a business and what it could accomplish. To that point, accounting had been viewed as a record of the past. McKinsey spun it around and aimed it at the future, turning it into a tool of effective management. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=198))

- The key business problem identified during this transition—and one that underwrote McKinsey’s success for several decades—was that a single, central office could no longer adequately administer such far-flung empires. Power had to be ceded to the extremities. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=246))

- The innovators moved from the centralized system to a multidivisional structure with product and geographic breakdowns. The concept left operating division chiefs with total control over everything except funding resources. Top managers took a more universal view of the business, monitoring the divisions and allocating capital accordingly.

- The intended effect of these measures was to prevent corporations from colluding with one another to fix prices and otherwise manipulate the markets. The unintended effect, according to historian Christopher McKenna, was to accelerate the creation of an informal—but legal—way of sharing information among oligopolists. Who could do that? Consultants.17 ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=267))

- This was the beginning of a decades-long separation of ownership from control in corporate America, and the consultant was an able ally to the professional manager in this tug-of-war—an ally who wasn’t gunning for the manager’s job. Thus began the era of managerial capitalism. ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=286))

- “Budgetary control involves the following,” McKinsey wrote. “1. The statement of the plans of all the departments of the business for a certain period of time in the form of estimates. 2. The coordination of these estimates into a well-balanced program for the business as a whole. 3. The preparation of reports showing a comparison between the actual and the estimated performance, and the revision of the original plans when these reports show that such a revision is necessary.”20 ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=304))

- Two subsequent books fleshed out McKinsey’s ideas: 1924’s Managerial Accounting and Business Administration. The former taught students how accounting data could be used to solve business problems. Using the data of traditional recordkeeping, he suggested the possibility for much greater control over a company’s destiny, including the establishment of standard procedures (how things should be done and to whom information should be reported), financial standards (ways to judge operating efficiency), and operating standards (including nonfinancial measures, such as quality).

- The emphasis in the GSO was more on why managers did things, as opposed to how they did them. Using the GSO, consultants started every engagement by thinking of the outlook for the industry of their client, the place of the client in the industry, the effectiveness of management, the state of its finances, and favorable or unfavorable factors that might affect the future of the firm.

- It is worth noting that the word “consultant” was not in the name of his firm. Rather, the term “management engineers” reflected the prevailing ethos of the time: that science held the answers to most serious questions, and even human commerce could profit from the rigors of this kind of data-driven analysis.

- Taylor’s famous time-and-motion studies used stopwatch analyses of manual labor with the goal of shaving seconds off rote, repeated activities, thereby enhancing productivity. There was, Taylor argued, just “one best way” to produce anything, and a manager armed with Taylor’s tools could identify it.

- The fact that just about anyone could call himself a consultant meant that shysters and scam artists abounded, tarnishing the entire field’s reputation. E. N. B. Mitton, a mining engineer who joined the British office of Bedaux in the 1930s, joked at the time that he would rather tell his mother that he was working “as a pianist in the local brothel” than admit that he had joined a consulting firm.31 ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=387))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- And just as McKinsey flipped accounting on its head, he and his contemporaries likewise turned Taylorism on its head. Instead of focusing on line workers at the bottom of the organizational chart, they zeroed in on the growing white-collar bureaucracy and top managers.32 ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=392))

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- McKinsey’s conclusion was that Marshall Field should specialize: unload its wholesale business, sell its 18 textile mills, focus entirely on retail, and cut, cut, cut. The board members of Marshall Field not only loved this idea but also asked McKinsey if he would carry it out. ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=425))

- Bower molded McKinsey into just the firm he had envisioned as a young lawyer: an organization that enjoyed the same prestige and influence as prominent law firms but didn’t spend time on the boring stuff. In other words, a law firm that didn’t practice law. ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=509))

- Association with a failing firm was toxic for a consultancy’s business. From this point forth, McKinsey & Company strove to stay well behind the scenes. It henceforth refused to reveal its client list and at the same time insisted that clients show similar discretion.

- By the time Bower was done at McKinsey, it was just the opposite: While the firm did not bear his name, everything else about it screamed Marvin. First and foremost: Everything was sacrificed at the altar of the client. The client, the client, the client. Bower saw himself as little more than a servant to client interests.

- Instead, Bower sold his shares back to the firm at book value. In doing so, he demonstrated precisely the kind of allegiance to the cause he expected of anyone wishing to be successful at McKinsey: He forsook considerable riches for the good of the institution, in the process giving young consultants the ability to buy their way into the partnership without mortgaging their houses to do so.

- The consultant would comport himself as a lawyer, with discretion and integrity; he would bring scientific, fact-based rigor and precision to the task, like an engineer or accountant. Like a doctor, he would dispense advice to unhealthy companies on how to get better and to healthy companies on how to stay that way. And, like a priest, he would serve his clients.

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Another way of looking at it: It’s hard to get any business done in the United States without hiring a lawyer. If Bower could achieve a similar result for McKinsey, the firm could entrench itself in the economy. ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=610))

- First, the consultant must put his client’s interests ahead of the firm’s interests. If a McKinsey consultant thinks a study is not in the interests of a client—a waste of money, or a misguided investigation—he must tell the client so. Second, he must adhere to the highest standards of truthfulness, integrity, and trustworthiness. Third, he must keep to himself the client’s private and proprietary information. Fourth, he must maintain an independent position and tell the client the truth as he sees it. And fifth, he must provide only services that have real value.

If you were an airline passenger, and the pilot came aboard the plane and he wore shorts and a flaming scarf, would you have the same confidence as you did when he came on with his four stripes on the shoulder?

- Most McKinsey reports begin with a page titled “Today’s Discussion.” It’s a brief of what the consultants hope to get across to the client, presented in outline form, and it shows not just how McKinsey presents but how its consultants are taught to think: in logical, well-structured, and easy-to-follow steps. A McKinsey consultant, according to the Bower way, was never supposed to put his personal stamp on anything. ([Location 699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=699))

- That same year, McKinsey, Wellington inaugurated its reading program for associates, complete with required book reports.

- The firm demanded that every consultant read at least fifteen books in the coming year, and submit book reports to partner Harrison Roddick in New York.

- McKinsey insisted that it would work only for the chief executives of firms and not be shunted off to their underlings. Anything that wasn’t important enough to involve the CEO wasn’t important enough for the consultants. This had the added advantage of freeing McKinsey from having to offer specialized, technical advice. CEOs didn’t have time for such intricate details, so McKinsey didn’t bother with them either. This became a major piece of the firm’s identity: Narrow expertise is for chumps; we do vision. ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=812))

- But the idea caught on. Between 1950 and 1959, as the proportion of consultants at the firm with MBAs climbed from 20 percent to over 80 percent, the median age of McKinsey consultants dropped by almost ten years.54 Younger and hungrier—and a lot cheaper. Betting on potential has become one of McKinsey’s defining characteristics. The idea was simple: It was easier to mold a young mind than to change an older one. “Harvard . . . doesn’t teach you accounting or finance,” McKinsey alum and convicted fraud Jeff Skilling once said. “They teach you how to be convincing.”55 ([Location 1139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=1139))

- McKinsey embraced the notion of staffing leverage as much as any other. In 1960, 176 nonconsulting staff members supported the 165 consultants at McKinsey. In other words, the 42 partners had 300 other people working for them, a “leverage ratio” of seven to one.68 Most consultants can bill a maximum of 2,000 hours per year. Utilization between 80 and 100 percent is considered achievable.69 The challenge of this “pyramid” form is stretching top talent across many projects at once, while fresh-faced Harvard graduates carry on the legwork. Partners then take home the lion’s share of the money earned through the work of junior consultants—a departure from earlier, experience-based consulting firms that had no such junior talent to exploit.

Second, it compelled the client to then read McKinsey’s latest thinking. And third, it gave the firm a chance to follow up.

It’s about helping people manage what one might call Industrial Prussianism—organizing activities through highly rational bureaucratic routines that promote effectiveness, efficiency, and honesty.

- Industrial Prussianism skips the heroes and focuses on efficiency and frugality, with training and accountability. The only point of strategic planning is to think through all contingencies in advance so as to make fewer tactical execution errors; he who makes the fewest and has the best-organized and best-trained troops wins. The companies that survive, like the best armies, can recover from unexpected blows of fate and competitor breakthroughs.

- Even today, the best consultants are ex-engineers, not perfectly designed social operators with a Harvard MBA. Engineering teaches you to define your solution space, determine the relevant levers you can pull or push, and then find your solution. Strategize all you want, but if your processes aren’t well oiled, you’re a goner. ([Location 2628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=2628))

- “To calculate the return on investment of a project that’s still in R&D means you’re projecting sales way out into the future. You can project anything you want, which makes it a totally useless way of selecting projects. The way you should select R&D projects is based on what it does to your competitive position. Or whether it opens up a new market to you.”5 ([Location 2745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=2745))

- According to historian Matthias Kipping, there are three waves in the history of consulting. The first wave ushered the industry into existence: the Taylorist focus on efficiency enhancement. The second was consulting top management on organization and strategy. And the third was advice on information technology (IT) based networking. By the late 1980s, it was no secret that a company’s IT strategy could be the difference between staying in the game and permanently falling behind.

- In the late 1990s the firm made another run at the technology-consulting action, but this time it was from the ground up, launching a Business Technology Office. The goal wasn’t to compete head-on with the accounting firms—McKinsey’s relatively low associate-to-partner ratios wouldn’t support such economics—but to advise the chief information officer on information-technology management, providing answers to questions like: How do you run your IT department? How do you prioritize projects? How do you keep IT costs down? “Because we’re not actual vendors of technology like most IT consultants, we’re sitting on the same side of the table as the CIO, not the opposite side,” said Mattern. “That’s an enormously powerful and valuable position to be in.”14 ([Location 2842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=2842))

- In 2003 Dirk Kurjuweit wrote Our Efficient Life: The Dictatorship of the Economy and Its Consequences, about the ruthless obsession with corporate profits. He decried the simplistic and fundamentally inhumane notion of a society in which efficiency is the ultimate goal. “In the Middle Ages, the church influenced thought and conduct,” he wrote. “Since the enlightenment, reason was regarded as the standard of all conduct. Today, the economy plays this role and marks our ideas of happiness, love and meaning of life.” ([Location 3005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=3005))

- Despite some missteps, Gluck also grasped that the firm had to do a better job publicizing its accomplishments. Under his direction, in 1990 the firm launched the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), an independent research operation with the goal of developing “substantive points of view on the critical issues” faced by McKinsey clients.41 ([Location 3083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=3083))

- As critics of Enron emerged and started to question the firm’s accounting methods, McKinsey issued ever more ringing endorsements. As far as McKinsey was concerned, “[deal-making] skills have become more important than scale or scope, and strategic insight and foresight more important than structural position.”17 It’s a statement that is baffling in its implication—that what matters is not what you actually are, but what you want to be.

- Nearly all of Enron’s allegedly innovative approaches ended up playing a significant role in the firm’s collapse. Being asset-light left Enron with unsustainable debts. Being loose-tight excused a laissez-faire culture in which executives acted without oversight. Off-balance-sheet financing turned out to be a way to deceive investors and the IRS.

- Enron’s success was McKinsey’s success. More precisely, Skilling’s success was McKinsey’s success.

- Ultimately, it was Skilling’s disavowal of hard assets in favor of trading that doomed the enterprise. “All that trading and marketing is wonderful,” said a former Enron executive, “but if you’re going to be in the energy business, sooner or later you need to be turning on a generator or producing gas or oil.” What Skilling had created was a trading firm.

- Using so-called special purpose vehicles, the company had pretended to be far less indebted than it actually was. Enron’s balance sheet at the end showed debts of $13 billion. Add in the off-balance-sheet liabilities, though, and the total nearly tripled, to $38 billion. The collapse of the firm was the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history at the time. And McKinsey’s Houston office saw its revenues fall off a cliff. ([Location 3495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=3495))

- The Enron debacle had a similar perverse result for McKinsey. Among other things, it helped spur the creation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which put executives and boards of directors more squarely in the gun sights of prosecutors. Whom have those boards hired to help shield themselves from liability? Consultants, of course. McKinsey’s failures at Enron contributed, in a roundabout way, to its continuing success.

- It wasn’t just dot-com startups that were alluring. A whole new class of consulting firm burst onto the scene, with hipper names—Razorfish, Scient, Viant, and Sapient—and sexier projects.

- The experience revealed the downside of McKinsey’s cherished ethos of hiring good people and just letting them do their thing. When you employ ten thousand people around the world, and you let local offices take care of their own hiring without any centralized oversight—or, equally important, without centralized financial planning—the entire institution can be put at real economic risk by a sudden external change.

- “I think the fundamental problem at McKinsey is that they have no real product,” she continued. “What do you do when there’s nothing there? You commoditize things that other people consider part of life, like personality and intelligence. You turn them into ‘units.’ They objectify basic human ideas and force them into ‘workflows’ and ‘dichotomies’ and ‘frameworks.’ These are not intellectuals. They are institutional people. They are people who spent a lot of time in the library memorizing things. They may talk of their new ‘framework,’ but it’s not like it’s an electric car or something.” ([Location 4193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A287PG2&location=4193))
