- While my family’s history of mental illness was cutting through my consciousness like a red line, my scientific work as a cancer biologist was also converging on the normalcy and abnormalcy of genes. Cancer, perhaps, is an ultimate perversion of genetics—a genome that becomes pathologically obsessed with replicating itself. The genome-as-self-replicating-machine co-opts the physiology of a cell, resulting in a shape-shifting illness that, despite significant advances, still defies our ability to treat or cure it.

- Three profoundly destabilizing scientific ideas ricochet through the twentieth century, trisecting it into three unequal parts: the atom, the byte, the gene. Each is foreshadowed by an earlier century, but dazzles into full prominence in the twentieth. Each begins its life as a rather abstract scientific concept, but grows to invade multiple human discourses—thereby transforming culture, society, politics, and language. But the most crucial parallel between the three ideas, by far, is conceptual: each represents the irreducible unit—the building block, the basic organizational unit—of a larger whole: the atom, of matter; the byte (or “bit”), of digitized information; the gene, of heredity and biological information. ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=234))
- The atom, the byte, and the gene provide fundamentally new scientific and technological understandings of their respective systems. You cannot explain the behavior of matter—why gold gleams; why hydrogen combusts with oxygen—without invoking the atomic nature of matter. Nor can you understand the complexities of computing—the nature of algorithms, or the storage or corruption of data—without comprehending the structural anatomy of digitized information. “Alchemy could not become chemistry until its fundamental units were discovered,” a nineteenth-century scientist wrote. By the same token, as I argue in this book, it is impossible to understand organismal and cellular biology or evolution—or human pathology, behavior, temperament, illness, race, and identity or fate—without first reckoning with the concept of the gene. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=249))
- The atom provides an organizing principle for modern physics—and it tantalizes us with the prospect of controlling matter and energy. The gene provides an organizing principle for modern biology—and it tantalizes us with the prospect of controlling our bodies and fates. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=284))
- The “action” of a gene is described in mechanistic terms: genes encode chemical messages to build proteins that ultimately enable form and function. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=294))
- A century after Pythagoras’s death, Plato, writing in 380 BC, was captivated by this metaphor. In one of the most intriguing passages in The Republic—borrowed, in part, from Pythagoras—Plato argued that if children were the arithmetic derivatives of their parents, then, at least in principle, the formula could be hacked: perfect children could be derived from perfect combinations of parents breeding at perfectly calibrated times. A “theorem” of heredity existed; it was merely waiting to be known. By unlocking the theorem and then enforcing its prescriptive combinations, any society could guarantee the production of the fittest children—unleashing a sort of numerological eugenics: “For when your guardians are ignorant of the law of births, and unite bride and bridegroom out of season, the children will not be goodly or fortunate,” Plato concluded. The guardians of his republic, its elite ruling class, having deciphered the “law of births,” would ensure that only such harmonious “fortunate” unions would occur in the future. A political utopia would develop as a consequence of genetic utopia. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=435))
- Aristotle offered an alternative theory that was strikingly radical for its time: perhaps females, like males, contribute actual material to the fetus—a form of female semen. And perhaps the fetus is formed by the mutual contributions of male and female parts. Grasping for analogies, Aristotle called the male contribution a “principle of movement.” “Movement,” here, was not literally motion, but instruction, or information—code, to use a modern formulation. The actual material exchanged during intercourse was merely a stand-in for a more obscure and mysterious exchange. Matter, in fact, didn’t really matter; what passed from man to woman was not matter, but message. Like an architectural plan for a building, or like a carpenter’s handiwork to a piece of wood, male semen carried the instructions to build a child. “[Just as] no material part comes from the carpenter to the wood in which he works,” Aristotle wrote, “but the shape and the form are imparted from him to the material by means of the motion he sets up. . . . In like manner, Nature uses the semen as a tool.” ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=464))
- Aristotle was wrong in his partitioning of male and female contributions into “material” and “message,” but abstractly, he had captured one of the essential truths about the nature of heredity. The transmission of heredity, as Aristotle perceived it, was essentially the transmission of information. Information was then used to build an organism from scratch: message became material. And when an organism matured, it generated male or female semen again—transforming material back to message. In fact, rather than Pythagoras’s triangle, there was a circle, or a cycle, at work: form begat information, and then information begat form. Centuries later, the biologist Max Delbrück would joke that Aristotle should have been given the Nobel Prize posthumously—for the discovery of DNA. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=476))
- Darwin’s interest ranged far beyond theology. Holed up in a room above a tobacconist’s shop on Sidney Street, he had occupied himself by collecting beetles, studying botany and geology, learning geometry and physics, and arguing hotly about God, divine intervention, and the creation of animals. More than theology or philosophy, Darwin was drawn to natural history—the study of the natural world using systematic scientific principles. ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=543))
- It was this static view of nature that Darwin found troubling. A natural historian should be able to describe the state of the natural world in terms of causes and effects, Darwin reasoned—just as a physicist might describe the motion of a ball in the air. The essence of Darwin’s disruptive genius was his ability to think about nature not as fact—but as process, as progression, as history. It was a quality that he shared with Mendel. Both obsessive observers of the natural world, Darwin and Mendel made their crucial leaps by asking variants of the same question: How does “nature” come into being? Mendel’s question was microscopic: How does a single organism transmit information to its offspring over a single generation? Darwin’s question was macroscopic: How do organisms transmute information about their features over a thousand generations? In time, both visions would converge, giving rise to the most important synthesis in modern biology, and the most powerful understanding of human heredity. ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=587))
- On October 20, Darwin returned to sea, headed toward Tahiti. Back in his room aboard the Beagle, he began to systematically analyze the corpses of the birds that he had collected. The mockingbirds, in particular, surprised him. There were two or three varieties, but each subtype was markedly distinct, and each was endemic to one particular island. Offhandedly, he scribbled one of the most important scientific sentences that he would ever write: “Each variety is constant in its own Island.” Was the same pattern true of other animals—of the tortoises, say? Did each island have a unique tortoise type? He tried, belatedly, to establish the same pattern for the turtles—but it was too late. He and the crew had eaten the specimens for lunch. ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=630))
- while Owen, Gould, and Lyell named and classified the South American treasures, Darwin turned his mind to other problems. He was not a splitter, but a lumper, a seeker of deeper anatomy. Taxonomy and nomenclature were, for him, merely means to an end. His instinctive genius lay in unearthing patterns—systems of organization—that lay behind the specimens; not in Kingdoms and Orders, but in kingdoms of order that ran through the biological world. ([Location 641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=641))
- Already, the bare outline of an idea was coalescing in his mind—a notion so simple, and yet so deeply radical, that no biologist had dared to explore it fully: What if all the finches had arisen from a common ancestral finch? What if the small armadillos of today had arisen from a giant ancestral armadillo? Lyell had argued that the current landscape of the earth was the consequence of natural forces that had accumulated over millions of years. In 1796, the French physicist Pierre-Simon Laplace had proposed that even the current solar system had arisen from the gradual cooling and condensation of matter over millions of years (when Napoléon had asked Laplace why God was so conspicuously missing from his theory, Laplace had replied with epic cheekiness: “Sire, I had no need for that hypothesis”). What if the current forms of animals were also the consequence of natural forces that had accumulated over millennia? ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=657))
- In Malthus’s paper, Darwin immediately saw a solution to his quandary. This struggle for survival was the shaping hand. Death was nature’s culler, its grim shaper. “It at once struck me,” he wrote, “that under these circumstances [of natural selection], favourable variations would tend to be preserved and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The results of this would be the formation of a new species.”I ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=698))
- Darwin now had the skeletal sketch of his master theory. When animals reproduce, they produce variants that differ from the parents.II Individuals within a species are constantly competing for scarce resources. When these resources form a critical bottleneck—during a famine, for instance—a variant better adapted for an environment is “naturally selected.” The best adapted—the “fittest”—survive (the phrase survival of the fittest was borrowed from the Malthusian economist Herbert Spencer). These survivors then reproduce to make more of their kind, thereby driving evolutionary change within a species. ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=702))
- As new Malthusian limits were imposed—diseases, famines, parasites—new breeds gained a stronghold, and the population shifted again. Freaks became norms, and norms became extinct. Monster by monster, evolution advanced. ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=712))
- Darwin tried to envision a theory of heredity that would be compatible with evolution. But here his crucial intellectual shortcoming came to the fore: he was not a particularly gifted experimentalist. Mendel, as we shall see, was an instinctual gardener—a breeder of plants, a counter of seeds, an isolator of traits; Darwin was a garden digger—a classifier of plants, an organizer of specimens, a taxonomist. Mendel’s gift was experimentation—the manipulation of organisms, cross-fertilization of carefully selected sub-breeds, the testing of hypotheses. Darwin’s gift was natural history—the reconstruction of history by observing nature. Mendel, the monk, was an isolator; Darwin, who had once aspired to be a parson, a synthesizer. ([Location 796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=796))
- Jenkin’s central problem with Darwin was this: if hereditary traits kept “blending” with each other in every generation, then what would keep any variation from being diluted out immediately by interbreeding? “The [variant] will be swamped by the numbers,” Jenkin wrote, “and after a few generations its peculiarity will be obliterated.” As an example—colored deeply by the casual racism of his era—Jenkin concocted a story: “Suppose a white man to have been wrecked on an island inhabited by negroes. . . . Our shipwrecked hero would probably become king; he would kill a great many blacks in the struggle for existence; he would have a great many wives and children.” But if genes blended with each other, then Jenkin’s “white man” was fundamentally doomed—at least in a genetic sense. His children—from black wives—would presumably inherit half his genetic essence. His grandchildren would inherit a quarter; his great-grandchildren, an eighth; his great-great-grandchildren, one-sixteenth, and so forth—until his genetic essence had been diluted, in just a few generations, into complete oblivion. Even if “white genes” were the most superior—the “fittest,” to use Darwin’s terminology—nothing would protect them from the inevitable decay caused by blending. In the end, the lone white king of the island would vanish from its genetic history—even though he had fathered more children than any other man of his generation, and even though his genes were best suited for survival. The particular details of Jenkin’s story were ugly—perhaps deliberately so—but its conceptual point was clear. If heredity had no means of maintaining variance—of “fixing” the altered trait—then all alterations in characters would eventually vanish into colorless oblivion by virtue of blending. Freaks would always remain freaks—unless they could guarantee the passage of their traits to the next generation. ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=827))
- Darwin was deeply struck by Jenkin’s reasoning. “Fleeming Jenkins [sic] has given me much trouble,” he wrote, “but has been of more use to me than any other Essay or Review.” There was no denying Jenkin’s inescapable logic: to salvage Darwin’s theory of evolution, he needed a congruent theory of heredity. But what features of heredity might solve Darwin’s problem? For Darwinian evolution to work, the mechanism of inheritance had to possess an intrinsic capacity to conserve information without becoming diluted or dispersed. Blending would not work. There had to be atoms of information—discrete, insoluble, indelible particles—moving from parent to child. ([Location 849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=849))
- “How small a thought it takes to fill someone’s whole life,” the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote. Indeed, at first glance, Mendel’s life seemed to be filled with the smallest thoughts. Sow, pollinate, bloom, pluck, shell, count, repeat. The process was excruciatingly dull—but small thoughts, Mendel knew, often bloomed into large principles. If the powerful scientific revolution that had swept through Europe in the eighteenth century had one legacy, it was this: the laws that ran through nature were uniform and pervasive. The force that drove Newton’s apple from the branch to his head was the same force that guided planets along their celestial orbits. If heredity too had a universal natural law, then it was likely influencing the genesis of peas as much as the genesis of humans. ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=920))
- But where had the recessive trait disappeared? Had it been consumed or eliminated by the dominant allele? Mendel deepened his analysis with his second experiment. He bred short-tall hybrids with short-tall hybrids to produce third-generation progeny. Since tallness was dominant, all the parental plants in this experiment were tall to start; the recessive trait had disappeared. But when crossed with each other, Mendel found, they yielded an entirely unexpected result. In some of these third-generation crosses, shortness reappeared—perfectly intact—after having disappeared for a generation. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=938))
- A “hybrid” organism, Mendel realized, was actually a composite—with a visible, dominant allele and a latent, recessive allele ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=943))
- Heredity, Mendel’s experiments implied, could only be explained by the passage of discrete pieces of information from parents to offspring. Sperm brought one copy of this information (an allele); the egg brought the other copy (a second allele); an organism thus inherited one allele from each parent. When that organism generated sperm or eggs, the alleles were split up again—one was passed to the sperm, and one to the egg, only to become combined in the next generation. One allele might “dominate” the other when both were present. When the dominant allele was present, the recessive allele seemed to disappear, but when a plant received two recessive alleles, the allele reiterated its character. Throughout, the information carried by an individual allele remained indivisible. The particles themselves remained intact.

- In the summer of 1878, a thirty-year-old Dutch botanist named Hugo de Vries traveled to England to see Darwin. It was more of a pilgrimage than a scientific visit. Darwin was vacationing at his sister’s estate in Dorking, but de Vries tracked him down and traveled out to meet him. Gaunt, intense, and excitable, with Rasputin’s piercing eyes and a beard that rivaled Darwin’s, de Vries already looked like a younger version of his idol. He also had Darwin’s persistence. The meeting must have been exhausting, for it lasted only two hours, and Darwin had to excuse himself to take a break. But de Vries left England transformed. With no more than a brief conversation, Darwin had inserted a sluice into de Vries’s darting mind, diverting it forever. Back in Amsterdam, de Vries abruptly terminated his prior work on the movement of tendrils in plants and threw himself into solving the mystery of heredity.

- Weismann had proposed a radical alternative: perhaps hereditary information was contained exclusively in sperm and egg cells, with no direct mechanism for an acquired characteristic to be transmitted into sperm or eggs. No matter how ardently the giraffe’s ancestor stretched its neck, it could not convey that information into its genetic material. Weismann called this hereditary material germplasm and argued that it was the only method by which an organism could generate another organism. Indeed, all of evolution could be perceived as the vertical transfer of germplasm from one generation to the next: an egg was the only way for a chicken to transfer information to another chicken.

- In his experimental gardens in Munich and Tübingen, about four hundred miles from the abbey, Correns thus laboriously bred tall plants with short plants and made hybrid-hybrid crosses—with no knowledge that he was just methodically repeating Mendel’s prior work. When Correns completed his experiments and was ready to assemble his paper for publication, he returned to the library to find references to his scientific predecessors. He thus stumbled on Mendel’s earlier paper buried in the Brno journal. ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1095))

- But de Vries also took his experiments further than Mendel. He may have been preempted in the discovery of heritable units—but as de Vries delved more deeply into heredity and evolution, he was struck by a thought that must also have perplexed Mendel: How did variants arise in the first place? What force made tall versus short peas, or purple flowers and white ones? ([Location 1111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1111))

- De Vries quickly realized the importance of his observation: these mutants had to be the missing pieces in Darwin’s puzzle. Indeed, if you coupled the genesis of spontaneous mutants—the giant-leaved Oenothera, say—with natural selection, then Darwin’s relentless engine was automatically set in motion. Mutations created variants in nature: long-necked antelopes, short-beaked finches, and giant-leaved plants arose spontaneously in the vast tribes of normal specimens (contrary to Lamarck, these mutants were not generated purposefully, but by random chance). These variant qualities were hereditary—carried as discrete instructions in sperm and eggs. As animals struggled to survive, the best-adapted variants—the fittest mutations—were serially selected. Their children inherited these mutations and thus generated new species, thereby driving evolution. Natural selection was not operating on organisms but on their units of heredity. A chicken, de Vries realized, was merely an egg’s way of making a better egg. ([Location 1122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1122))

- More than any scientist before him, Bateson also grasped the idea that the discontinuous nature of genetic information carried vast implications for the future of human genetics. If genes were, indeed, independent particles of information, then it should be possible to select, purify, and manipulate these particles independently from one another. Genes for “desirable” attributes might be selected or augmented, while undesirable genes might be eliminated from the gene pool. In principle, a scientist should be able to change the “composition of individuals,” and of nations, and leave a permanent mark on human identity. “When power is discovered, man always turns to it,” Bateson wrote darkly. “The science of heredity will soon provide power on a stupendous scale; and in some country, at some time not, perhaps, far distant, that power will be applied to control the composition of a nation. Whether the institution of such control will ultimately be good or bad for that nation, or for humanity at large, is a separate question.” He had preempted the century of the gene.

- In 1883, one year after Charles Darwin’s death, Darwin’s cousin Francis Galton published a provocative book—Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development—in which he laid out a strategic plan for the improvement of the human race. Galton’s idea was simple: he would mimic the mechanism of natural selection. If nature could achieve such remarkable effects on animal populations through survival and selection, Galton imagined accelerating the process of refining humans via human intervention. The selective breeding of the strongest, smartest, “fittest” humans—unnatural selection—Galton imagined, could achieve over just a few decades what nature had been attempting for eons. Galton needed a word for this strategy. “We greatly want a brief word to express the science of improving stock,” he wrote, “to give the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable.” For Galton, the word eugenics was an opportune fit—“at least a neater word . . . than viriculture, which I once ventured to use.” It combined the Greek prefix eu—“good”—with genesis: “good in stock, hereditarily endowed with noble qualities.” Galton—who never blanched from the recognition of his own genius—was deeply satisfied with his coinage: “Believing, as I do, that human eugenics will become recognised before long as a study of the highest practical importance, it seems to me that no time ought to be lost in . . . compiling personal and family histories.” ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1175))

- Like Fleeming Jenkin, Galton quickly realized that his cousin had got the principle right, but not the mechanism: the nature of inheritance was crucial to the understanding of Darwin’s theory. Heredity was the yin to evolution’s yang. The two theories had to be congenitally linked—each bolstering and completing the other. If “cousin Darwin” had solved half the puzzle, then “cousin Galton” was destined to crack the other. ([Location 1201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1201))

- Bateson’s “awakening” was not private in the least. Between 1900 and 1910, as evidence for Mendel’s “units of heredity” mounted, biologists were confronted by the impact of the new theory. The implications were deep. Aristotle had recast heredity as the flow of information—a river of code moving from egg to the embryo. Centuries later, Mendel had stumbled on the essential structure of that information, the alphabet of the code. If Aristotle had described a current of information moving across generations, then Mendel had found its currency. But perhaps an even greater principle was at stake, Bateson realized. The flow of biological information was not restricted to heredity. It was coursing through all of biology. The transmission of hereditary traits was just one instance of information flow—but if you looked deeply, squinting your conceptual lenses, it was easy to imagine information moving pervasively through the entire living world. The unfurling of an embryo; the reach of a plant toward sunlight; the ritual dance of bees—every biological activity required the decoding of coded instructions. Might Mendel, then, have also stumbled on the essential structure of these instructions? Were units of information guiding each of these processes? “Each of us who now looks at his own patch of work sees Mendel’s clues running through it,” Bateson proposed. “We have only touched the edge of that new country which is stretching out before us. . . . The experimental study of heredity . . . is second to no branch of science in the magnitude of the results it offers.” ([Location 1281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1281))

- But in science, a word is a hypothesis. In natural language, a word is used to convey an idea. But in scientific language, a word conveys more than an idea—a mechanism, a consequence, a prediction. A scientific noun can launch a thousand questions—and the idea of the “gene” did exactly that. What was the chemical and physical nature of the gene? How was the set of genetic instructions, the genotype, translated into the actual physical manifestations, the phenotype, of an organism? How were genes transmitted? Where did they reside? How were they regulated? If genes were discrete particles specifying one trait, then how could this property be reconciled with the occurrence of human characteristics, say, height or skin color, in continuous curves? How does the gene permit genesis? ([Location 1306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1306))

- Galton and his friends were chilled by the fear of race degeneration (Galton’s own encounter with the “savage races,” symptomatic of Britain’s encounter with colonial natives throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, had also convinced him that the racial purity of whites had to be maintained and protected against the forces of miscegenation). The Second Reform Act of 1867 had given working-class men in Britain the right to vote. By 1906, even the best-guarded political bastions had been stormed—twenty-nine seats in Parliament had fallen to the Labour Party—sending spasms of anxiety through English high society. The political empowerment of the working class, Galton believed, would just provoke their genetic empowerment: they would produce bushels of children, dominate the gene pool, and drag the nation toward profound mediocrity. The homme moyen would degenerate. The “mean man” would become even meaner. ([Location 1366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1366))

- Indeed, Wells had only articulated what many in Galton’s inner circle felt deeply but had not dared to utter—that eugenics would only work if the selective breeding of the strong (so-called positive eugenics) was augmented with selective sterilization of the weak—negative eugenics. In 1911, Havelock Ellis, Galton’s colleague, twisted the image of Mendel, the solitary gardener, to service his enthusiasm for sterilization: “In the great garden of life it is not otherwise than in our public gardens. We repress the license of those who, to gratify their own childish or perverted desires, would pluck up the shrubs or trample on the flowers, but in so doing we achieve freedom and joy for all. . . . We seek to cultivate the sense of order, to encourage sympathy and foresight, to pull up racial weeds by the roots. . . . In these matters, indeed, the gardener in his garden is our symbol and our guide.” ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1378))

- Morgan had discovered an important modification to Mendel’s laws. Genes did not travel separately; instead, they moved in packs. Packets of information were themselves packaged—into chromosomes, and ultimately in cells. But the discovery had a more important consequence: conceptually, Morgan had not just linked genes; he had linked two disciplines—cell biology and genetics. The gene was not a “purely theoretical unit.” It was a material thing that lived in a particular location, and a particular form, within a cell. “Now that we locate them [genes] on chromosomes,” Morgan reasoned, “are we justified in regarding them as material units; as chemical bodies of a higher order than molecules?” ([Location 1685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1685))

- Scientists studying living organisms were far more preoccupied with other matters: embryology, cell biology, the origin of species, and evolution. How do cells function? How does an organism arise from an embryo? How do species originate? What generates the diversity of the natural world? Yet, attempts to answer these questions had all become mired at precisely the same juncture. The missing link, in all cases, was information. Every cell, and every organism, needs information to carry out its physiological function—but where does that information come from? ([Location 1774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1774))
- In 1918, Fisher published his analysis in a paper entitled “The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance.” The title was rambling, but the message was succinct: if you mixed the effects of three to five variant genes on any trait, you could generate nearly perfect continuity in phenotype. “The exact amount of human variability,” he wrote, could be explained by rather obvious extensions of Mendelian genetics. The individual effect of a gene, Fisher argued, was like a dot of a pointillist painting. If you zoomed in close enough, you might see the dots as individual, discrete. But what we observed and experienced in the natural world from afar was an aggregation of dots: pixels merging to form a seamless picture. ([Location 1829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1829))
- To explain the intersection of genetics, natural selection, and evolution in formal terms, Dobzhansky resurrected two important words—genotype and phenotype. A genotype is an organism’s genetic composition. It can refer to one gene, a configuration of genes, or even an entire genome. A phenotype, in contrast, refers to an organism’s physical or biological attributes and characteristics—the color of an eye, the shape of a wing, or resistance to hot or cold temperatures. ([Location 1867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1867))
- Dobzhansky could now restate the essential truth of Mendel’s discovery—a gene determines a physical feature—by generalizing that idea across multiple genes and multiple features: a genotype determines a phenotype ([Location 1870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1870))
- If Dobzhansky had capriciously trimmed the wings of all the flies in one box, he would have affected their phenotypes—the shape of their wings—without ever touching their genes. In other words: genotype + environment = phenotype ([Location 1876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1876))
- some genes are activated by external triggers or by random chance. In flies, for instance, a gene that determines the size of a vestigial wing depends on temperature: you cannot predict the shape of the wing based on the fly’s genes or on the environment alone; you need to combine the two pieces of information. For such genes, neither the genotype nor the environment is the sole predictor of outcome: it is the intersection of genes, environment, and chance. ([Location 1878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1878))
- So the final modification might be read as: genotype + environment + triggers + chance = phenotype ([Location 1889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1889))
- The process of selection, notably, acts on a physical or biological attribute—and the underlying genes are selected passively as a result. A misshapen nose might be the result of a particularly bad day in the ring—i.e., it may have nothing to do with genes—but if a mating contest is judged only by the symmetry of noses, then the bearer of the wrong kind of nose will be eliminated. Even if that bearer possesses multiple other genes that are salubrious in the long run—a gene for tenacity or for withstanding excruciating pain—the entire gamut of these genes will be damned to extinction during the mating contest, all because of that damned nose. Phenotype, in short, drags genotypes behind it, like a cart pulling a horse. ([Location 1896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1896))
- By the late 1930s, Dobzhansky began to realize that his understanding of genes, variation, and natural selection had ramifications far beyond biology. The bloody revolution of 1917 that had swept through Russia attempted to erase all individual distinctions to prioritize a collective good. In contrast, a monstrous form of racism that was rising in Europe exaggerated and demonized individual distinctions. In both cases, Dobzhansky noted, the fundamental questions at stake were biological. What defines an individual? How does variation contribute to individuality? What is “good” for a species?

- Muller was catapulted into international fame by his discovery. The effect of radiation on the mutation rate in flies had two immediate implications. First, genes had to be made of matter. Radiation, after all, is merely energy. Frederick Griffith had made genes move between organisms. Muller had altered genes using energy. A gene, whatever it was, was capable of motion, transmission, and of energy-induced change—properties generally associated with chemical matter. But more than the material nature of the gene, it was the sheer malleability of the genome—that X-rays could make such Silly Putty of genes—that stunned scientists.

- Amid the voluminous chaff, two contributions stand out. The first was methodological: Nazi scientists advanced the “twin study”—although, characteristically, they soon morphed it into a ghastly form. Twin studies had originated in Francis Galton’s work in the 1890s. Having coined the phrase nature versus nurture, Galton had wondered how a scientist might discern the influence of one over the other. How could one determine if any particular feature—height or intelligence, say—was the product of nature or nurture? How could one unbraid heredity and environment? Galton proposed piggybacking on a natural experiment. Since twins share identical genetic material, he reasoned, any substantial similarities between them could be attributed to genes, while any differences were the consequence of environment. By studying twins, and comparing and contrasting similarities and differences, a geneticist could determine the precise contributions of nature versus nurture to important traits.

- Like musicians, like mathematicians—like elite athletes—scientists peak early and dwindle fast. It isn’t creativity that fades, but stamina: science is an endurance sport. To produce that single illuminating experiment, a thousand nonilluminating experiments have to be sent into the trash; it is battle between nature and nerve.

- Life may be chemistry, but it’s a special circumstance of chemistry. Organisms exist not because of reactions that are possible, but because of reactions that are barely possible. Too much reactivity and we would spontaneously combust. Too little, and we would turn cold and die. Proteins enable these barely possible reactions, allowing us to live on the edges of chemical entropy—skating perilously, but never falling in.

- It is the form of hemoglobin, then, that permits its function. The physical structure of the molecule enables its chemical nature, the chemical nature enables its physiological function, and its physiology ultimately permits its biological activity. The complex workings of living beings can be perceived in terms of these layers: physics enabling chemistry, and chemistry enabling physiology. To Schrödinger’s “What is life?” a biochemist might answer, “If not chemicals.” And what are chemicals—a biophysicist might add—if not molecules of matter?

- biophysicists were intent on restoring a rigidly mechanistic description to biology. Living physiology should be explicable in terms of physics, biophysicists argued—forces, motions, actions, motors, engines, levers, pulleys, clasps. The laws that drove Newton’s apples to the ground should also apply to the growth of the apple tree. Invoking special vital forces or inventing mystical fluids to explain life was unnecessary. Biology was physics. Machina en deus. ([Location 2475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=2475))

- To decipher the structure of DNA, Wilkins had decided to corral a set of biophysical techniques invented in nearby Cambridge—crystallography and X-ray diffraction. To understand the basic outline of this technique, imagine trying to deduce the shape of a minute three-dimensional object—a cube, say. You cannot “see” this cube nor feel its edges—but it shares the one property that all physical objects must possess: it generates shadows. Imagine that you can shine light at the cube from various angles and record the shadows that are formed. Placed directly in front of the light, a cube casts a square shadow. Illuminated obliquely, it forms a diamond. Move the light source again, and the shadow is a trapezoid. The process is almost absurdly laborious—like sculpting a face out of a million silhouettes—but it works: piece by piece, a set of two-dimensional images can be transmuted into a three-dimensional form. X-ray diffraction arises out of analogous principles—the “shadows” are actually the scatters of X-rays generated by a crystal—except to illuminate molecules and generate scatters in the molecular world, one needs the most powerful source of light: X-rays. And there’s a subtler problem: molecules generally refuse to sit still for their portraits. In liquid or gas form, molecules whiz dizzily in space, moving randomly, like particles of dust. Shine light on a million moving cubes and you only get a hazy, moving shadow, a molecular version of television static. The only solution to the problem is ingenious: transform a molecule from a solution to a crystal—and its atoms are instantly locked into position. Now the shadows become regular; the lattices generate ordered and readable silhouettes. By shining X-rays at a crystal, a physicist can decipher its structure in three-dimensional space. At Caltech, two physical chemists, Linus Pauling and Robert Corey, had used this technique to solve the structures of several protein fragments—a feat that would win Pauling the Nobel Prize in 1954.

- The noise that bothered Franklin most was the fuzzy static in the DNA pictures. Wilkins had obtained some highly purified DNA from a Swiss lab and stretched it into thin, uniform fibers. By stringing the fiber along a gap in a stretch of wire—a bent paper clip worked marvelously—he hoped to diffract X-rays and obtain images. But the material had proved difficult to photograph; it generated scattered, fuzzy dots on film. What made a purified molecule so difficult to image? she wondered. Soon, she stumbled on the answer. In its pure state, DNA came in two forms. In the presence of water, the molecule was in one configuration, and as it dried out, it switched to another. As the experimental chamber lost its humidity, the DNA molecules relaxed and tensed—exhaling, inhaling, exhaling, like life itself. The switch between the two forms was partly responsible for the noise that Wilkins had been struggling to minimize. Franklin adjusted the humidity of the chamber using an ingenious apparatus that bubbled hydrogen through salt water. As she increased the wetness of DNA in the chamber, the fibers seemed to relax permanently. She had tamed them at last. Within weeks, she was taking pictures of DNA of a quality and clarity that had never before been seen. J. D. Bernal, the crystallographer, would later call them the “most beautiful X ray photographs of any substance ever taken.” ([Location 2527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=2527))

- Watson knew “nothing about the X-ray diffraction technique,” but he had an unfailing intuition about the importance of certain biological problems. Trained as an ornithologist at the University of Chicago, he had assiduously “avoid[ed] taking any chemistry or physics courses which looked of even medium difficulty.” But a kind of homing instinct had led him to DNA. He too had read Schrödinger’s What Is Life? and been captivated. He had been working on the chemistry of nucleic acids in Copenhagen—“a complete flop,” as he would later describe it—but Wilkins’s photograph entranced him. “The fact that I was unable to interpret it did not bother me. It was certainly better to imagine myself becoming famous than maturing into a stifled academic who had never risked a thought.” ([Location 2548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=2548))

- Here, Watson and Crick took their most intuitive scientific leap. What if the solution to the structure of DNA could be achieved by the same “tricks” that Pauling had pulled? X-ray pictures would help, of course—but trying to determine structures of biological molecules using experimental methods, Crick argued, was absurdly laborious—“like trying to determine the structure of a piano by listening to the sound it made while being dropped down a flight of stairs.” But what if the structure of DNA was so simple—so elegant—that it could be deduced by “common sense,” by model building? What if a stick-and-stone assemblage could solve DNA? ([Location 2592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=2592))

- Crick had tried to stabilize the “wobbly unstable chains” by putting the phosphate backbone in the center. But phosphates are negatively charged. If they faced inside the chain, they would repel each other, forcing the molecule to fly apart in a nanosecond. To solve the problem of repulsion, Crick had inserted a positively charged magnesium ion at the center of the helix—like a last-minute dab of molecular glue to hold the structure together. But Franklin’s measurements suggested that magnesium could not be at the center. Worse, the structure modeled by Watson and Crick was so tightly packed that it could not accommodate any significant number of water molecules. In their rush to build a model, they had even forgotten Franklin’s first discovery: the remarkable “wetness” of DNA.

- In keeping with the grand tradition of counterposing the most significant discoveries in biology with supreme understatement—recall Mendel, Avery, and Griffith—Watson and Crick added a final line to their paper: “It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.” The most important function of DNA—its capacity to transmit copies of information from cell to cell, and organism to organism—was buried in the structure. Message; movement; information; form; Darwin; Mendel; Morgan: all was writ into that precarious assemblage of molecules.

- But if a mutation disrupts the function of an enzyme, then the normal gene must specify the information to make the normal enzyme. A unit of heredity must carry the code to build a metabolic or cellular function specified by a protein. “A gene,” Beadle wrote in 1945, “can be visualized as directing the final configuration of a protein molecule.” This was the “action of the gene” that a generation of biologists had been trying to comprehend: a gene “acts” by encoding information to build a protein, and the protein actualizes the form or function of the organism. ([Location 2847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=2847))
- Brenner and Jacob finally purified a minuscule amount of the messenger molecule out of bacterial cells. It was RNA, as expected—but RNA of a special kind.II The messenger was generated afresh when a gene was translated. Like DNA, these RNA molecules were built by stringing together four bases—A, G, C, and U (in the RNA copy of a gene, remember, the T found in DNA is substituted for U). Notably, Brenner and Jacob later discovered the messenger RNA was a facsimile of the DNA chain—a copy made from the original. The RNA copy of a gene then moved from the nucleus to the cytosol, where its message was decoded to build a protein. The messenger RNA was neither an inhabitant of heaven nor of hell—but a professional go-between. The generation of an RNA copy of a gene was termed transcription—referring to the rewriting of a word or sentence in a language close to the original. A gene’s code (ATGGGCC . . .) was transcribed into an RNA code (AUGGGCC . . .). ([Location 2900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=2900))
- The process was akin to a library of rare books that is accessed for translation. The master copy of information—i.e., the gene—was stored permanently in a deep repository or vault. When a “translation request” was generated by a cell, a photocopy of the original was summoned from the vault of the nucleus. This facsimile of a gene (i.e., RNA) was used as a working source for translation into a protein. The process allowed multiple copies of a gene to be in circulation at the same time, and for the RNA copies to be increased or decreased on demand—facts that would soon prove to be crucial to the understanding of a gene’s activity and function. ([Location 2908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=2908))
- Francis Crick called this flow of information the “central dogma” of biological information. The word dogma was an odd choice (Crick later admitted that he never understood the linguistic implications of dogma, which implies a fixed, immutable belief)—but the central was an accurate description. Crick was referring to the striking universality of the flow of genetic information throughout biology.IV From bacteria to elephants—from red-eyed flies to blue-blooded princes—biological information flowed through living systems in a systematic, archetypal manner: DNA provided instructions to build RNA. RNA provided instructions to build proteins. Proteins ultimately enabled structure and function—bringing genes to life.

- It was a Rube Goldberg disease. A change in the sequence of a gene caused the change in the sequence of a protein; that warped its shape; that shrank a cell; that clogged a vein; that jammed the flow; that racked the body (that genes built). Gene, protein, function, and fate were strung in a chain: one chemical alteration in one base pair in DNA was sufficient to “encode” a radical change in human fate.

- What enabled the selective “action” of hemoglobin in red blood cells? Why was there no hemoglobin in his eye or his skin—even though eye cells and skin cells and, indeed, every cell in the human body possessed identical copies of the same gene? How, as Thomas Morgan had put it, did “the properties implicit in genes become explicit in [different] cells?” ([Location 3007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=3007))
- By the late 1940s, Monod had discovered that the kink was the result of a metabolic readjustment. When bacteria switched from glucose to lactose consumption, they induced specific lactose-digesting enzymes. When they switched back to glucose, these enzymes disappeared and glucose-digesting enzymes reappeared. The induction of these enzymes during the switch—like changing cutlery between dinner courses (remove the fish knife; set the dessert fork)—took a few minutes, thereby resulting in the observed pause in growth. To Monod, diauxie suggested that genes could be regulated by metabolic inputs. If enzymes—i.e., proteins—were being induced to appear and disappear in a cell, then genes must be being turned on and off, like molecular switches (enzymes, after all, are encoded by genes). ([Location 3036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=3036))
- As with flies, the bacterial mutants proved revealing. Monod and Jacob, working with Arthur Pardee, a microbial geneticist from America, discovered three cardinal principles that governed the regulation of genes. First, when a gene was turned on or off, the DNA master copy was always kept intact in a cell. The real action was in RNA: when a gene was turned on, it was induced to make more RNA messages and thereby produce more sugar-digesting enzymes. A cell’s metabolic identity—i.e., whether it was consuming lactose or glucose—could be ascertained not by the sequence of its genes, which was always constant, but by the amount of RNA that a gene was producing. During lactose metabolism, the RNAs for lactose-digesting enzymes were abundant. During glucose metabolism, those messages were repressed, and the RNAs for glucose-digesting enzymes became abundant. Second, the production of RNA messages was coordinately regulated. When the sugar source was switched to lactose, the bacteria turned on an entire module of genes—several lactose-metabolizing genes—to digest lactose. One of the genes in the module specified a “transporter protein” that allowed lactose to enter the bacterial cell. Another gene encoded an enzyme that was needed to break down lactose into parts. Yet another specified an enzyme to break those chemical parts into subparts. Surprisingly, all the genes dedicated to a particular metabolic pathway were physically present next to each other on the bacterial chromosome—like library books stacked by subject—and they were induced simultaneously in cells. The metabolic alteration produced a profound genetic alteration in a cell. It wasn’t just a cutlery switch; the whole dinner service was altered in a single swoop. A functional circuit of genes was switched on and off, as if operated by a common spool or a master switch. Monod called one such gene module an operon.II The genesis of proteins was thus perfectly synchronized with the requirements of the environment: supply the correct sugar, and a set of sugar-metabolizing genes would be turned on together. The terrifying economy of evolution had again produced the most elegant solution to gene regulation. No gene, no message, and no protein labored in vain. ([Location 3044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=3044))
- How did a lactose-sensing protein recognize and regulate only a lactose-digesting gene—and not the thousands of other genes in a cell? The third cardinal feature of gene regulation, Monod and Jacob discovered, was that every gene had specific regulatory DNA sequences appended to it that acted like recognition tags. Once a sugar-sensing protein had detected sugar in the environment, it would recognize one such tag and turn the target genes on or off. That was a gene’s signal to make more RNA messages and thereby generate the relevant enzyme to digest the sugar. A gene, in short, possessed not just information to encode a protein, but also information about when and where to make that protein. All that data was encrypted in DNA, typically appended to the… ([Location 3061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=3061))
- In Jacob and Monod’s model, in contrast, bacterial genes were strung together for a reason. Genes that operated on the same metabolic pathway were physically linked to each other: if you worked together, then you lived together in the genome. Specific sequences of DNA were appended to a gene that provided context for its activity—its “work.” These sequences, meant to turn genes on and off, might be likened to punctuation marks and annotations—inverted quotes, a comma, a capitalized letter—in a sentence: they… ([Location 3071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=3071))
- Even though every cell contains the same set of genes—an identical genome—the selective activation or repression of particular subsets of genes allows an individual cell to respond to its environments. The genome was an active blueprint—capable of deploying selected parts of its code at different times and in different circumstances. ([Location 3080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=3080))
- Proteins act as regulatory sensors, or master switches, in this process—turning on and turning off genes, or even combinations of genes, in a coordinate manner. Like the master score of a bewitchingly complex symphonic work, the genome contains the instructions for the development and maintenance of organisms. But the genomic “score” is inert without proteins. Proteins actualize this information—by activating or repressing genes (some of these regulatory proteins are also called transcription factors). They conduct the genome, thereby playing out its music—activating the viola at the fourteenth minute, a crash of cymbals during the arpeggio, a roll of drums at the crescendo. ([Location 3083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=3083))
- It was through gene regulation, Monod argued, that cells could achieve their unique functions in time and space. “The genome contains not only a series of blue-prints [i.e., genes], but a co-ordinated program . . . and a means of controlling its execution,” Monod and Jacob concluded. Walter Noel’s red blood cells and liver cells contained the same genetic information—but gene regulation ensured that the hemoglobin protein was only present in red blood cells, and not in the liver. The caterpillar and the butterfly carry precisely the same genome—but gene regulation enables the metamorphosis of one into the other. ([Location 3092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=3092))
- There is a recursion here that is worth noting: like all proteins, DNA polymerase, the enzyme that enables DNA to replicate, is itself the product of a gene.IV Built into every genome, then, are the codes for proteins that will allow that genome to reproduce. This additional layer of complexity—that DNA encodes a protein that allows DNA to replicate—is important because it provides a critical node for regulation. DNA replication can be turned on and turned off by other signals and regulators, such as the age or the nutritional status of a cell, thus allowing cells to make DNA copies only when they are ready to divide. This scheme has a collateral rub: when the regulators themselves go rogue, nothing can stop a cell from replicating continuously. That, as we will soon learn, is the ultimate disease of malfunctioning genes—cancer. ([Location 3124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=3124))
- Mutations occur when DNA is damaged by chemicals or X-rays, or when the DNA replication enzyme makes a spontaneous error in copying genes. But a second mechanism of generating genetic diversity exists: genetic information can be swapped between chromosomes. DNA from the maternal chromosome can exchange positions with DNA from the paternal chromosome—potentially generating a gene hybrid of maternal and paternal genes. Recombination is also a form of “mutation”—except whole chunks of genetic material are swapped between chromosomes. ([Location 3142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=3142))
- When DNA is damaged by a mutagen, such as X-rays, genetic information is obviously threatened. When such damage occurs, the gene can be recopied from the “twin” copy on the paired chromosome: part of the maternal copy may be redrafted from the paternal copy, again resulting in the creation of hybrid genes. ([Location 3152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=3152))
- A gene, Morgan had noted, was an extraordinary solution to an extraordinary problem. Sexual reproduction demands the collapse of an organism into a single cell, but then requires that single cell to expand back into an organism. The gene, Morgan realized, solves one problem—the transmission of heredity—but creates another: the development of organisms. A single cell must be capable of carrying the entire set of instructions to build an organism from scratch—hence genes. But how do genes make a whole organism grow back out of a single cell?

- The building of organs and structures, Lewis concluded, is encoded by master-regulatory “effector” genes that work like autonomous units or subroutines. During the normal genesis of a fly (or any other organism), these effector genes kick into action at specified sites and at specified times and determine the identities of segments and organs. These master-regulatory genes work by turning other genes on and off; they can be likened to circuits in a microprocessor. Mutations in the genes thus result in malformed, ectopic segments and organs. Like the Red Queen’s bewildered servants in Alice in Wonderland, the genes scurry about to enact the instructions—build a thorax, make a wing—but in the wrong places or at the wrong times. If a master regulator shouts, “ON with an antenna,” then the antenna-building subroutine is turned on and an antenna is built—even if that structure happens to be growing out of the thorax or abdomen of a fly.
