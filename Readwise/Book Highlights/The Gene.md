## Highlights
- While my family’s history of mental illness was cutting through my consciousness like a red line, my scientific work as a cancer biologist was also converging on the normalcy and abnormalcy of genes. Cancer, perhaps, is an ultimate perversion of genetics—a genome that becomes pathologically obsessed with replicating itself. The genome-as-self-replicating-machine co-opts the physiology of a cell, resulting in a shape-shifting illness that, despite significant advances, still defies our ability to treat or cure it.

- Three profoundly destabilizing scientific ideas ricochet through the twentieth century, trisecting it into three unequal parts: the atom, the byte, the gene. Each is foreshadowed by an earlier century, but dazzles into full prominence in the twentieth. Each begins its life as a rather abstract scientific concept, but grows to invade multiple human discourses—thereby transforming culture, society, politics, and language. But the most crucial parallel between the three ideas, by far, is conceptual: each represents the irreducible unit—the building block, the basic organizational unit—of a larger whole: the atom, of matter; the byte (or “bit”), of digitized information; the gene, of heredity and biological information. ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=234))
- The atom, the byte, and the gene provide fundamentally new scientific and technological understandings of their respective systems. You cannot explain the behavior of matter—why gold gleams; why hydrogen combusts with oxygen—without invoking the atomic nature of matter. Nor can you understand the complexities of computing—the nature of algorithms, or the storage or corruption of data—without comprehending the structural anatomy of digitized information. “Alchemy could not become chemistry until its fundamental units were discovered,” a nineteenth-century scientist wrote. By the same token, as I argue in this book, it is impossible to understand organismal and cellular biology or evolution—or human pathology, behavior, temperament, illness, race, and identity or fate—without first reckoning with the concept of the gene. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=249))
- The atom provides an organizing principle for modern physics—and it tantalizes us with the prospect of controlling matter and energy. The gene provides an organizing principle for modern biology—and it tantalizes us with the prospect of controlling our bodies and fates. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=284))
- The “action” of a gene is described in mechanistic terms: genes encode chemical messages to build proteins that ultimately enable form and function. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=294))
- A century after Pythagoras’s death, Plato, writing in 380 BC, was captivated by this metaphor. In one of the most intriguing passages in The Republic—borrowed, in part, from Pythagoras—Plato argued that if children were the arithmetic derivatives of their parents, then, at least in principle, the formula could be hacked: perfect children could be derived from perfect combinations of parents breeding at perfectly calibrated times. A “theorem” of heredity existed; it was merely waiting to be known. By unlocking the theorem and then enforcing its prescriptive combinations, any society could guarantee the production of the fittest children—unleashing a sort of numerological eugenics: “For when your guardians are ignorant of the law of births, and unite bride and bridegroom out of season, the children will not be goodly or fortunate,” Plato concluded. The guardians of his republic, its elite ruling class, having deciphered the “law of births,” would ensure that only such harmonious “fortunate” unions would occur in the future. A political utopia would develop as a consequence of genetic utopia. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=435))
- Aristotle offered an alternative theory that was strikingly radical for its time: perhaps females, like males, contribute actual material to the fetus—a form of female semen. And perhaps the fetus is formed by the mutual contributions of male and female parts. Grasping for analogies, Aristotle called the male contribution a “principle of movement.” “Movement,” here, was not literally motion, but instruction, or information—code, to use a modern formulation. The actual material exchanged during intercourse was merely a stand-in for a more obscure and mysterious exchange. Matter, in fact, didn’t really matter; what passed from man to woman was not matter, but message. Like an architectural plan for a building, or like a carpenter’s handiwork to a piece of wood, male semen carried the instructions to build a child. “[Just as] no material part comes from the carpenter to the wood in which he works,” Aristotle wrote, “but the shape and the form are imparted from him to the material by means of the motion he sets up. . . . In like manner, Nature uses the semen as a tool.” ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=464))
- Aristotle was wrong in his partitioning of male and female contributions into “material” and “message,” but abstractly, he had captured one of the essential truths about the nature of heredity. The transmission of heredity, as Aristotle perceived it, was essentially the transmission of information. Information was then used to build an organism from scratch: message became material. And when an organism matured, it generated male or female semen again—transforming material back to message. In fact, rather than Pythagoras’s triangle, there was a circle, or a cycle, at work: form begat information, and then information begat form. Centuries later, the biologist Max Delbrück would joke that Aristotle should have been given the Nobel Prize posthumously—for the discovery of DNA.

- Darwin’s interest ranged far beyond theology. Holed up in a room above a tobacconist’s shop on Sidney Street, he had occupied himself by collecting beetles, studying botany and geology, learning geometry and physics, and arguing hotly about God, divine intervention, and the creation of animals. More than theology or philosophy, Darwin was drawn to natural history—the study of the natural world using systematic scientific principles. ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=543))
- It was this static view of nature that Darwin found troubling. A natural historian should be able to describe the state of the natural world in terms of causes and effects, Darwin reasoned—just as a physicist might describe the motion of a ball in the air. The essence of Darwin’s disruptive genius was his ability to think about nature not as fact—but as process, as progression, as history. It was a quality that he shared with Mendel. Both obsessive observers of the natural world, Darwin and Mendel made their crucial leaps by asking variants of the same question: How does “nature” come into being? Mendel’s question was microscopic: How does a single organism transmit information to its offspring over a single generation? Darwin’s question was macroscopic: How do organisms transmute information about their features over a thousand generations? In time, both visions would converge, giving rise to the most important synthesis in modern biology, and the most powerful understanding of human heredity. ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=587))
- On October 20, Darwin returned to sea, headed toward Tahiti. Back in his room aboard the Beagle, he began to systematically analyze the corpses of the birds that he had collected. The mockingbirds, in particular, surprised him. There were two or three varieties, but each subtype was markedly distinct, and each was endemic to one particular island. Offhandedly, he scribbled one of the most important scientific sentences that he would ever write: “Each variety is constant in its own Island.” Was the same pattern true of other animals—of the tortoises, say? Did each island have a unique tortoise type? He tried, belatedly, to establish the same pattern for the turtles—but it was too late. He and the crew had eaten the specimens for lunch. ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=630))
- while Owen, Gould, and Lyell named and classified the South American treasures, Darwin turned his mind to other problems. He was not a splitter, but a lumper, a seeker of deeper anatomy. Taxonomy and nomenclature were, for him, merely means to an end. His instinctive genius lay in unearthing patterns—systems of organization—that lay behind the specimens; not in Kingdoms and Orders, but in kingdoms of order that ran through the biological world. ([Location 641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=641))
- Already, the bare outline of an idea was coalescing in his mind—a notion so simple, and yet so deeply radical, that no biologist had dared to explore it fully: What if all the finches had arisen from a common ancestral finch? What if the small armadillos of today had arisen from a giant ancestral armadillo? Lyell had argued that the current landscape of the earth was the consequence of natural forces that had accumulated over millions of years. In 1796, the French physicist Pierre-Simon Laplace had proposed that even the current solar system had arisen from the gradual cooling and condensation of matter over millions of years (when Napoléon had asked Laplace why God was so conspicuously missing from his theory, Laplace had replied with epic cheekiness: “Sire, I had no need for that hypothesis”). What if the current forms of animals were also the consequence of natural forces that had accumulated over millennia? ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=657))
- In Malthus’s paper, Darwin immediately saw a solution to his quandary. This struggle for survival was the shaping hand. Death was nature’s culler, its grim shaper. “It at once struck me,” he wrote, “that under these circumstances [of natural selection], favourable variations would tend to be preserved and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The results of this would be the formation of a new species.”I ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=698))
- Darwin now had the skeletal sketch of his master theory. When animals reproduce, they produce variants that differ from the parents.II Individuals within a species are constantly competing for scarce resources. When these resources form a critical bottleneck—during a famine, for instance—a variant better adapted for an environment is “naturally selected.” The best adapted—the “fittest”—survive (the phrase survival of the fittest was borrowed from the Malthusian economist Herbert Spencer). These survivors then reproduce to make more of their kind, thereby driving evolutionary change within a species. ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=702))
- As new Malthusian limits were imposed—diseases, famines, parasites—new breeds gained a stronghold, and the population shifted again. Freaks became norms, and norms became extinct. Monster by monster, evolution advanced. ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=712))
- Darwin tried to envision a theory of heredity that would be compatible with evolution. But here his crucial intellectual shortcoming came to the fore: he was not a particularly gifted experimentalist. Mendel, as we shall see, was an instinctual gardener—a breeder of plants, a counter of seeds, an isolator of traits; Darwin was a garden digger—a classifier of plants, an organizer of specimens, a taxonomist. Mendel’s gift was experimentation—the manipulation of organisms, cross-fertilization of carefully selected sub-breeds, the testing of hypotheses. Darwin’s gift was natural history—the reconstruction of history by observing nature. Mendel, the monk, was an isolator; Darwin, who had once aspired to be a parson, a synthesizer. ([Location 796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=796))
- Jenkin’s central problem with Darwin was this: if hereditary traits kept “blending” with each other in every generation, then what would keep any variation from being diluted out immediately by interbreeding? “The [variant] will be swamped by the numbers,” Jenkin wrote, “and after a few generations its peculiarity will be obliterated.” As an example—colored deeply by the casual racism of his era—Jenkin concocted a story: “Suppose a white man to have been wrecked on an island inhabited by negroes. . . . Our shipwrecked hero would probably become king; he would kill a great many blacks in the struggle for existence; he would have a great many wives and children.” But if genes blended with each other, then Jenkin’s “white man” was fundamentally doomed—at least in a genetic sense. His children—from black wives—would presumably inherit half his genetic essence. His grandchildren would inherit a quarter; his great-grandchildren, an eighth; his great-great-grandchildren, one-sixteenth, and so forth—until his genetic essence had been diluted, in just a few generations, into complete oblivion. Even if “white genes” were the most superior—the “fittest,” to use Darwin’s terminology—nothing would protect them from the inevitable decay caused by blending. In the end, the lone white king of the island would vanish from its genetic history—even though he had fathered more children than any other man of his generation, and even though his genes were best suited for survival. The particular details of Jenkin’s story were ugly—perhaps deliberately so—but its conceptual point was clear. If heredity had no means of maintaining variance—of “fixing” the altered trait—then all alterations in characters would eventually vanish into colorless oblivion by virtue of blending. Freaks would always remain freaks—unless they could guarantee the passage of their traits to the next generation. ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=827))
- Darwin was deeply struck by Jenkin’s reasoning. “Fleeming Jenkins [sic] has given me much trouble,” he wrote, “but has been of more use to me than any other Essay or Review.” There was no denying Jenkin’s inescapable logic: to salvage Darwin’s theory of evolution, he needed a congruent theory of heredity. But what features of heredity might solve Darwin’s problem? For Darwinian evolution to work, the mechanism of inheritance had to possess an intrinsic capacity to conserve information without becoming diluted or dispersed. Blending would not work. There had to be atoms of information—discrete, insoluble, indelible particles—moving from parent to child. ([Location 849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=849))
- “How small a thought it takes to fill someone’s whole life,” the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote. Indeed, at first glance, Mendel’s life seemed to be filled with the smallest thoughts. Sow, pollinate, bloom, pluck, shell, count, repeat. The process was excruciatingly dull—but small thoughts, Mendel knew, often bloomed into large principles. If the powerful scientific revolution that had swept through Europe in the eighteenth century had one legacy, it was this: the laws that ran through nature were uniform and pervasive. The force that drove Newton’s apple from the branch to his head was the same force that guided planets along their celestial orbits. If heredity too had a universal natural law, then it was likely influencing the genesis of peas as much as the genesis of humans. ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=920))
- But where had the recessive trait disappeared? Had it been consumed or eliminated by the dominant allele? Mendel deepened his analysis with his second experiment. He bred short-tall hybrids with short-tall hybrids to produce third-generation progeny. Since tallness was dominant, all the parental plants in this experiment were tall to start; the recessive trait had disappeared. But when crossed with each other, Mendel found, they yielded an entirely unexpected result. In some of these third-generation crosses, shortness reappeared—perfectly intact—after having disappeared for a generation. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=938))
- A “hybrid” organism, Mendel realized, was actually a composite—with a visible, dominant allele and a latent, recessive allele ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=943))
- Heredity, Mendel’s experiments implied, could only be explained by the passage of discrete pieces of information from parents to offspring. Sperm brought one copy of this information (an allele); the egg brought the other copy (a second allele); an organism thus inherited one allele from each parent. When that organism generated sperm or eggs, the alleles were split up again—one was passed to the sperm, and one to the egg, only to become combined in the next generation. One allele might “dominate” the other when both were present. When the dominant allele was present, the recessive allele seemed to disappear, but when a plant received two recessive alleles, the allele reiterated its character. Throughout, the information carried by an individual allele remained indivisible. The particles themselves remained intact.

- In the summer of 1878, a thirty-year-old Dutch botanist named Hugo de Vries traveled to England to see Darwin. It was more of a pilgrimage than a scientific visit. Darwin was vacationing at his sister’s estate in Dorking, but de Vries tracked him down and traveled out to meet him. Gaunt, intense, and excitable, with Rasputin’s piercing eyes and a beard that rivaled Darwin’s, de Vries already looked like a younger version of his idol. He also had Darwin’s persistence. The meeting must have been exhausting, for it lasted only two hours, and Darwin had to excuse himself to take a break. But de Vries left England transformed. With no more than a brief conversation, Darwin had inserted a sluice into de Vries’s darting mind, diverting it forever. Back in Amsterdam, de Vries abruptly terminated his prior work on the movement of tendrils in plants and threw himself into solving the mystery of heredity.

- Weismann had proposed a radical alternative: perhaps hereditary information was contained exclusively in sperm and egg cells, with no direct mechanism for an acquired characteristic to be transmitted into sperm or eggs. No matter how ardently the giraffe’s ancestor stretched its neck, it could not convey that information into its genetic material. Weismann called this hereditary material germplasm and argued that it was the only method by which an organism could generate another organism. Indeed, all of evolution could be perceived as the vertical transfer of germplasm from one generation to the next: an egg was the only way for a chicken to transfer information to another chicken.

- In his experimental gardens in Munich and Tübingen, about four hundred miles from the abbey, Correns thus laboriously bred tall plants with short plants and made hybrid-hybrid crosses—with no knowledge that he was just methodically repeating Mendel’s prior work. When Correns completed his experiments and was ready to assemble his paper for publication, he returned to the library to find references to his scientific predecessors. He thus stumbled on Mendel’s earlier paper buried in the Brno journal. ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1095))

- But de Vries also took his experiments further than Mendel. He may have been preempted in the discovery of heritable units—but as de Vries delved more deeply into heredity and evolution, he was struck by a thought that must also have perplexed Mendel: How did variants arise in the first place? What force made tall versus short peas, or purple flowers and white ones? ([Location 1111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1111))

- De Vries quickly realized the importance of his observation: these mutants had to be the missing pieces in Darwin’s puzzle. Indeed, if you coupled the genesis of spontaneous mutants—the giant-leaved Oenothera, say—with natural selection, then Darwin’s relentless engine was automatically set in motion. Mutations created variants in nature: long-necked antelopes, short-beaked finches, and giant-leaved plants arose spontaneously in the vast tribes of normal specimens (contrary to Lamarck, these mutants were not generated purposefully, but by random chance). These variant qualities were hereditary—carried as discrete instructions in sperm and eggs. As animals struggled to survive, the best-adapted variants—the fittest mutations—were serially selected. Their children inherited these mutations and thus generated new species, thereby driving evolution. Natural selection was not operating on organisms but on their units of heredity. A chicken, de Vries realized, was merely an egg’s way of making a better egg. ([Location 1122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1122))

- More than any scientist before him, Bateson also grasped the idea that the discontinuous nature of genetic information carried vast implications for the future of human genetics. If genes were, indeed, independent particles of information, then it should be possible to select, purify, and manipulate these particles independently from one another. Genes for “desirable” attributes might be selected or augmented, while undesirable genes might be eliminated from the gene pool. In principle, a scientist should be able to change the “composition of individuals,” and of nations, and leave a permanent mark on human identity. “When power is discovered, man always turns to it,” Bateson wrote darkly. “The science of heredity will soon provide power on a stupendous scale; and in some country, at some time not, perhaps, far distant, that power will be applied to control the composition of a nation. Whether the institution of such control will ultimately be good or bad for that nation, or for humanity at large, is a separate question.” He had preempted the century of the gene.

- In 1883, one year after Charles Darwin’s death, Darwin’s cousin Francis Galton published a provocative book—Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development—in which he laid out a strategic plan for the improvement of the human race. Galton’s idea was simple: he would mimic the mechanism of natural selection. If nature could achieve such remarkable effects on animal populations through survival and selection, Galton imagined accelerating the process of refining humans via human intervention. The selective breeding of the strongest, smartest, “fittest” humans—unnatural selection—Galton imagined, could achieve over just a few decades what nature had been attempting for eons. Galton needed a word for this strategy. “We greatly want a brief word to express the science of improving stock,” he wrote, “to give the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable.” For Galton, the word eugenics was an opportune fit—“at least a neater word . . . than viriculture, which I once ventured to use.” It combined the Greek prefix eu—“good”—with genesis: “good in stock, hereditarily endowed with noble qualities.” Galton—who never blanched from the recognition of his own genius—was deeply satisfied with his coinage: “Believing, as I do, that human eugenics will become recognised before long as a study of the highest practical importance, it seems to me that no time ought to be lost in . . . compiling personal and family histories.” ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1175))

- Like Fleeming Jenkin, Galton quickly realized that his cousin had got the principle right, but not the mechanism: the nature of inheritance was crucial to the understanding of Darwin’s theory. Heredity was the yin to evolution’s yang. The two theories had to be congenitally linked—each bolstering and completing the other. If “cousin Darwin” had solved half the puzzle, then “cousin Galton” was destined to crack the other. ([Location 1201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1201))

- Bateson’s “awakening” was not private in the least. Between 1900 and 1910, as evidence for Mendel’s “units of heredity” mounted, biologists were confronted by the impact of the new theory. The implications were deep. Aristotle had recast heredity as the flow of information—a river of code moving from egg to the embryo. Centuries later, Mendel had stumbled on the essential structure of that information, the alphabet of the code. If Aristotle had described a current of information moving across generations, then Mendel had found its currency. But perhaps an even greater principle was at stake, Bateson realized. The flow of biological information was not restricted to heredity. It was coursing through all of biology. The transmission of hereditary traits was just one instance of information flow—but if you looked deeply, squinting your conceptual lenses, it was easy to imagine information moving pervasively through the entire living world. The unfurling of an embryo; the reach of a plant toward sunlight; the ritual dance of bees—every biological activity required the decoding of coded instructions. Might Mendel, then, have also stumbled on the essential structure of these instructions? Were units of information guiding each of these processes? “Each of us who now looks at his own patch of work sees Mendel’s clues running through it,” Bateson proposed. “We have only touched the edge of that new country which is stretching out before us. . . . The experimental study of heredity . . . is second to no branch of science in the magnitude of the results it offers.” ([Location 1281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1281))

- But in science, a word is a hypothesis. In natural language, a word is used to convey an idea. But in scientific language, a word conveys more than an idea—a mechanism, a consequence, a prediction. A scientific noun can launch a thousand questions—and the idea of the “gene” did exactly that. What was the chemical and physical nature of the gene? How was the set of genetic instructions, the genotype, translated into the actual physical manifestations, the phenotype, of an organism? How were genes transmitted? Where did they reside? How were they regulated? If genes were discrete particles specifying one trait, then how could this property be reconciled with the occurrence of human characteristics, say, height or skin color, in continuous curves? How does the gene permit genesis? ([Location 1306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1306))

- Galton and his friends were chilled by the fear of race degeneration (Galton’s own encounter with the “savage races,” symptomatic of Britain’s encounter with colonial natives throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, had also convinced him that the racial purity of whites had to be maintained and protected against the forces of miscegenation). The Second Reform Act of 1867 had given working-class men in Britain the right to vote. By 1906, even the best-guarded political bastions had been stormed—twenty-nine seats in Parliament had fallen to the Labour Party—sending spasms of anxiety through English high society. The political empowerment of the working class, Galton believed, would just provoke their genetic empowerment: they would produce bushels of children, dominate the gene pool, and drag the nation toward profound mediocrity. The homme moyen would degenerate. The “mean man” would become even meaner. ([Location 1366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1366))

- Indeed, Wells had only articulated what many in Galton’s inner circle felt deeply but had not dared to utter—that eugenics would only work if the selective breeding of the strong (so-called positive eugenics) was augmented with selective sterilization of the weak—negative eugenics. In 1911, Havelock Ellis, Galton’s colleague, twisted the image of Mendel, the solitary gardener, to service his enthusiasm for sterilization: “In the great garden of life it is not otherwise than in our public gardens. We repress the license of those who, to gratify their own childish or perverted desires, would pluck up the shrubs or trample on the flowers, but in so doing we achieve freedom and joy for all. . . . We seek to cultivate the sense of order, to encourage sympathy and foresight, to pull up racial weeds by the roots. . . . In these matters, indeed, the gardener in his garden is our symbol and our guide.” ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1378))

- Morgan had discovered an important modification to Mendel’s laws. Genes did not travel separately; instead, they moved in packs. Packets of information were themselves packaged—into chromosomes, and ultimately in cells. But the discovery had a more important consequence: conceptually, Morgan had not just linked genes; he had linked two disciplines—cell biology and genetics. The gene was not a “purely theoretical unit.” It was a material thing that lived in a particular location, and a particular form, within a cell. “Now that we locate them [genes] on chromosomes,” Morgan reasoned, “are we justified in regarding them as material units; as chemical bodies of a higher order than molecules?” ([Location 1685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B017I25DCC&location=1685))
