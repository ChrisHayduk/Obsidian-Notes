- is important to remember that all these science models are value-neutral. They can be used to illuminate both the positive and negative aspects of any situation. It’s up to you to ask yourself, what can this model show me about what not to do? Where will it help me find a better way forward?

- practice. Pick a new model every day, apply it to a situation you are in, and see if you can improve your understanding and decision-making. Finally, reflect. Take some time to evaluate your success and failures. In doing so, you will begin to learn the full potential of the toolkit you are building.
