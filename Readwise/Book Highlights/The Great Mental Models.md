## Highlights
- Munger has a way of thinking through problems using what he calls a broad latticework of mental models. These are chunks of knowledge from different disciplines that can be simplified and applied to better understand the world. The way he describes it, they help identify what information is relevant in any given situation, and the most reasonable parameters to work in.

- « You only think you know, as a matter of fact. And most of your actions are based on incomplete knowledge and you really don’t know what it is all about, or what the purpose of the world is, or know a great deal of other things. It is possible to live and not know. » Richard Feynman1 ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=88))

- In life and business, the person with the fewest blind spots wins. Removing blind spots means we see, interact with, and move closer to understanding reality. We think better. And thinking better is about finding simple processes that help us work through problems from multiple dimensions and perspectives, allowing us to better choose solutions that fit what matters to us. The skill for finding the right solutions for the right problems is one form of wisdom. ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=99))

- Mental models describe the way the world works. They shape how we think, how we understand, and how we form beliefs. Largely subconscious, mental models operate below the surface. We’re not generally aware of them and yet they’re the reason when we look at a problem we consider some factors relevant and others irrelevant. They are how we infer causality, match patterns, and draw analogies. They are how we think and reason. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=113))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Mental models operate below the level of consciousness
- We cannot keep all of the details of the world in our brains, so we use models to simplify the complex into understandable and organizable chunks. ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=117))

- Not having the ability to shift perspective by applying knowledge from multiple disciplines makes us vulnerable. ([Location 130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=130))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Multidisciplinary thinking, learning these mental models and applying them across our lives, creates less stress and more freedom. The more we can draw on the diverse knowledge contained in these models, the more solutions will present themselves. ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=131))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Using the lenses of our mental models helps us illuminate these interconnections. The more lenses used on a given problem, the more of reality reveals itself. The more of reality we see, the more we understand. The more we understand, the more we know what to do. ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=138))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- most problems are multidimensional, and thus having more lenses often offers significant help with the problems we are facing. ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=145))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- When understanding is separated from reality, we lose our powers. Understanding must constantly be tested against reality and updated accordingly. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=155))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The only way you’ll know the extent to which you understand reality is to put your ideas and understanding into action. If you don’t test your ideas against the real world—keep contact with the earth—how can you be sure you understand? ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=158))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Our failures to update from interacting with reality spring primarily from three things: not having the right perspective or vantage point, ego-induced denial, and distance from the consequences of our decisions. ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=166))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The first flaw is perspective. We have a hard time seeing any system that we are in. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=169))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- We must be open to other perspectives if we truly want to understand the results of our actions. ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=177))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The second flaw is ego. Many of us tend to have too much invested in our opinions of ourselves to see the world’s feedback—the feedback we need to update our beliefs about reality. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=179))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- First, we’re so afraid about what others will say about us that we fail to put our ideas out there and subject them to criticism. This way we can always be right. Second, if we do put our ideas out there and they are criticized, our ego steps in to protect us. We become invested in defending instead of upgrading our ideas. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=181))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The third flaw is distance. The further we are from the results of our decisions, the easier it is to keep our current views rather than update them. ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=184))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Organizations over a certain size often remove us from the direct consequences of our decisions. When we make decisions that other people carry out, we are one or more levels removed and may not immediately be able to update our understanding. ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=188))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Standard connsulting
- It’s easier to fool ourselves that we’re right at a high level than at the micro level, because at the micro level we see and feel the immediate consequences. When we touch that hot stove, the feedback is powerful and instantaneous. At a high or macro level we are removed from the immediacy of the situation, and our ego steps in to create a narrative that suits what we want to believe, instead of what really happened. ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=192))

- As Confucius said, “A man who has committed a mistake and doesn’t correct it, is committing another mistake.” ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=195))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- We also tend to undervalue the elementary ideas and overvalue the complicated ones. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=199))

- « Most geniuses—especially those who lead others—prosper not by deconstructing intricate complexities but by exploiting unrecognized simplicities. » Andy Benoit6 ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=208))

- understanding reality is not everything. The pursuit of understanding fuels meaning and adaptation, but this understanding, by itself, is not enough. Understanding only becomes useful when we adjust our behavior and actions accordingly. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=213))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- We are passive, thinking these things just happened to us and not that we did something to cause them. This passivity means that we rarely reflect on our decisions and the outcomes. Without reflection we cannot learn. Without learning we are doomed to repeat mistakes, become frustrated when the world doesn’t work the way we want it to, and wonder why we are so busy. The cycle goes on. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=227))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- We need to learn to understand when ego serves us and when it hinders us. Wrapping ego up in outcomes instead of in ourselves makes it easier to update our views. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=235))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Wrap your ego up in your goals and do everything to achieve them
- we also apply our understanding of gravity in other, less obvious ways. We use the model as a metaphor to explain the influence of strong personalities, as when we say, “He was pulled into her orbit.” This is a reference to our basic understanding of the role of mass in gravity—the more there is the stronger the pull. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=246))

- Better models mean better thinking. The degree to which our models accurately explain reality is the degree to which they improve our thinking. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=261))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Flawed models, regardless of intentions, cause harm when they are put to use. When it comes to applying mental models we tend to run into trouble either when our model of reality is wrong, that is, it doesn’t survive real world experience, or when our model is right and we apply it to a situation where it doesn’t belong. ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=265))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Only by repeated testing of our models against reality and being open to feedback can we update our understanding of the world and change our thinking. We need to look at the results of applying the model over the largest sample size possible to be able to refine it so that it aligns with how the world actually works. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=272))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The key here is variety. Most of us study something specific and don’t get exposure to the big ideas of other disciplines. We don’t develop the multidisciplinary mindset that we need to accurately see a problem. And because we don’t have the right models to understand the situation, we overuse the models we do have and use them even when they don’t belong. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=277))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Through their disciplines, each of these people sees part of the situation, the part of the world that makes sense to them. None of them, however, see the entire situation unless they are thinking in a multidisciplinary way. In short, they have blind spots. Big blind spots. ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=281))

- What are the three largest, most relevant sample sizes for identifying universal principles? Bucket number one is inorganic systems, which are 13.7 billion years in size. It’s all the laws of math and physics, the entire physical universe. Bucket number two is organic systems, 3.5 billion years of biology on Earth. And bucket number three is human history, you can pick your own number, I picked 20,000 years of recorded human behavior. Those are the three largest sample sizes we can access and the most relevant.” ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=287))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- the key to sample sizes is to look for them not just over space, but over time. You need to reach back into the past as far as you can to contribute to your sample. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=292))

- Charlie Munger summed up this approach to practical wisdom: “Well, the first rule is that you can’t really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang ‘em back. If the facts don’t hang together on a latticework of theory, you don’t have them in a usable form. You’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience both vicarious and direct on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You’ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head.”8 ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=314))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- once we learn something, we need to put it back into the complex system in which it occurs. We need to see where it connects to other bits of knowledge, to build our understanding of the whole. This is the value of putting the knowledge contained in mental models into a latticework. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=324))

- “80 or 90 important models will carry about 90 percent of the freight in making you a worldly-wise person. And, of those, only a mere handful really carry very heavy freight.” ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=333))

- «I think it is undeniably true that the human brain must work in models. The trick is to have your brain work better than the other person’s brain because it understands the most fundamental models: ones that will do most work per unit. If you get into the mental habit of relating what you’re reading to the basic structure of the underlying ideas being demonstrated, you gradually accumulate some wisdom.» Charlie Munger11 ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=340))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- It’s not just knowing the mental models that is important. First you must learn them, but then you must use them. Each decision presents an opportunity to comb through your repertoire and try one out, so you can also learn how to use them. This will slow you down at first, and you won’t always choose the right models, but you will get better and more efficient at using mental models as time progresses. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=346))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- You need to be deliberate about choosing the models you will use in a situation. As you use them, a great practice is to record and reflect. That way you can get better at both choosing models and applying them. Take the time to notice how you applied them, what the process was like, and what the results were. Over time you will develop your knowledge of which situations are best tackled through which models. ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=359))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- As soon as you begin to take in the knowledge that other people have of the world, like learning the perspectives others have of the elephant, you will start having more success because your decisions will be aligned with how the world really is.

- Even the best maps are imperfect. That’s because they are reductions of what they represent. If a map were to represent the territory with perfect fidelity, it would no longer be a reduction and thus would no longer be useful to us. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=394))

- Think of the financial statements for a company, which are meant to distill the complexity of thousands of transactions into something simpler. Or a policy document on office procedure, a manual on parenting a two-year-old, or your performance review. All are models or maps that simplify some complex territory in order to guide you through it. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=398))

- the description of the thing is not the thing itself. The model is not reality. The abstraction is not the abstracted. ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=405))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- We can lose the specific and relevant details that were distilled into an abstraction. And, because we often consume these abstractions as gospel, without having done the hard mental work ourselves, it’s tricky to see when the map no longer agrees with the territory. We inadvertently forget that the map is not reality. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=419))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Read primary sources and great books, draw your own conclusions
- When we mistake the map for reality, we start to think we have all the answers. We create static rules or policies that deal with the map but forget that we exist in a constantly changing world. ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=425))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Maps and models are not meant to live forever as static references. The world is dynamic. As territories change, our tools to navigate them must be flexible to handle a wide variety of situations or adapt to the changing times. ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=429))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- what physicists do so well, and most of us do so poorly, is that they carefully delimit what Newtonian and Einsteinian physics are able to explain. They know down to many decimal places where those maps are useful guides to reality, and where they aren’t. And when they hit uncharted territory, like quantum mechanics, they explore it carefully instead of assuming the maps they have can explain it all. ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=438))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Understand the assumptions your map makes and where those assumptions apply
- Any user of a map or model must realize that we do not understand a model, map, or reduction unless we understand and respect its limitations. If we don’t understand what the map does and doesn’t tell us, it can be useless or even dangerous. ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=443))

- What is common to many is taken least care of, for all men have greater regard for what is their own than for what they possess in common with others. –Aristotle ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=462))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- In order to use a map or model as accurately as possible, we should take three important considerations into account: Reality is the ultimate update. Consider the cartographer. Maps can influence territories. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=476))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- a map captures a territory at a moment in time. Just because it might have done a good job at depicting what was, there is no guarantee that it depicts what is there now or what will be there in the future. The faster the rate of change in the territory, the harder it will be for a map to keep up to date. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=493))

- Maps are not purely objective creations. They reflect the values, standards, and limitations of their creators. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=498))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Everything is presented from a particular perspective
- Models, then, are most useful when we consider them in the context they were created. What was the cartographer trying to achieve? How does this influence what is depicted in the map? ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=506))

- «In general, when building statistical models, we must not forget that the aim is to understand something about the real world. Or predict, choose an action, make a decision, summarize evidence, and so on, but always about the real world, not an abstract mathematical world: our models are not the reality. » ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=519))

- The idea a circle of competence in the realm of investments was stated very well by Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett. When asked, he recommended that each individual stick to their area of special competence, and be very reluctant to stray. For when we stray too far, we get into areas where we don’t even know what we don’t know. We may not even know the questions we need to ask.

- In a true science, as opposed to a pseudo-science, the following statement can be easily made: “If x happens, it would show demonstrably that theory y is not true.” We can then design an experiment, a physical one or sometimes a thought experiment, to figure out if x actually does happen.

- Here we hit on the problem of trying to assert any fundamental laws by which human history must inevitably progress. Trend is not destiny. Even if we can derive and understand certain laws of human biological nature, the trends of history itself are dependent on conditions, and conditions change.

- Sometimes called reasoning from first principles, it’s a tool to help clarify complicated problems by separating the underlying ideas or facts from any assumptions based on them. What remain are the essentials. If you know the first principles of something, you can build the rest of your knowledge around them to produce something new.

- Socratic questioning generally follows this process: Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas. (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?) Challenging assumptions. (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?) Looking for evidence. (How can I back this up? What are the sources?) Considering alternative perspectives. (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?) Examining consequences and implications. (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?) Questioning the original questions. (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?) Socratic questioning stops you from relying on your gut and limits strong emotional responses. This process helps you build something that lasts. ([Location 795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=795))

- We can think about three categories of objects: Ones that are harmed by volatility and unpredictability, ones that are neutral to volatility and unpredictability, and finally, ones that benefit from it. The latter category is antifragile—like a package that wants to be mishandled. Up to a point, certain things benefit from volatility, and that’s how we want to be. Why? Because the world is fundamentally unpredictable and volatile, and large events—panics, crashes, wars, bubbles, and so on—tend to have a disproportionate impact on outcomes. There are two ways to handle such a world: try to predict, or try to prepare. Prediction is tempting. For all of human history, seers and soothsayers have turned a comfortable trade. The problem is that nearly all studies of “expert” predictions in such complex real-world realms as the stock market, geopolitics, and global finance have proven again and again that, for the rare and impactful events in our world, predicting is impossible!

If something cannot be broken down any further, we must deal with it as it is. ([Location 1695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=1695))

- An explanation can be simplified only to the extent that it can still provide an accurate understanding. ([Location 1698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=1698))

- focusing on simplicity when all others are focused on complexity is a hallmark of genius, and it’s easier said than done. But always remembering that a simpler explanation is more likely to be correct than a complicated one goes a long way towards helping us conserve our most precious resources of time and energy.

- Hanlon’s Razor states that we should not attribute to malice that which is more easily explained by stupidity. ([Location 1712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=1712))

- a sort of tic in our mental machinery: we’re deeply affected by vivid, available evidence, to such a degree that we’re willing to make judgments that violate simple logic. We over-conclude based on the available information. We have no trouble packaging in unrelated factors if they happen to occur in proximity to what we already believe.

    - Note: Great storytelling can override logic. It is THE marketing and sales skill
- Always assuming malice puts you at the center of everyone else’s world. This is an incredibly self-centered approach to life. In reality, for every act of malice, there is almost certainly far more ignorance, stupidity, and laziness. ([Location 1744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=1744))

- When we assume someone is out to get us, our very natural instinct is to take actions to defend ourselves. It’s harder to take advantage of, or even see, opportunities while in this defensive mode because our priority is saving ourselves—which tends to reduce our vision to dealing with the perceived threat instead of examining the bigger picture.

    - Note: A defensive stance limits opportunity-taking because opportunities are inherently offensive in nature (you need to go out and HUNT/TAKE them. As such, negative world views are unhelpful EVEN IF THEY ARE TRUE. If my behavior is constrained by an unjust world, believing this to be the case only causes me to voluntarily constrain my own behavior further. An optimistic worldview, by contrast, encourages us to find the limits and boundaries of these constraints
- Although the explosions around the submarine could have been malicious, Arkhipov realized that to assume so would put the lives of billions in peril. Far better to suppose mistakes and ignorance, and base the decision not to launch on that. In doing so, he saved the world.

- of all possible motives behind an action, the ones that require the least amount of energy to execute (such as ignorance or laziness) are more likely to occur than one that requires active malice. ([Location 1789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P79P8ST&location=1789))
