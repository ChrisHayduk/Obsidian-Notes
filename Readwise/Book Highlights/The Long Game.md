## Highlights
- China’s decline was the product of the Qing Dynasty’s inability to reckon with transformative geopolitical and technological forces that had not been seen for three thousand years, forces which changed the international balance of power and ushered in China’s “Century of Humiliation.” ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=180))

- But both capture something essential: the idea that world order is once again at stake because of unprecedented geopolitical and technological shifts, and that this requires strategic adjustment. ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=186))

- On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. Then, a little more than three months later, a populist surge catapulted Donald Trump into office as president of the United States. From China’s perspective—which is highly sensitive to changes in its perceptions of American power and threat—these two events were shocking. Beijing believed that the world’s most powerful democracies were withdrawing from the international order they had helped erect abroad and were struggling to govern themselves at home.

- China that not only seeks regional influence as so many great powers do, but as Evan Osnos has argued, “that is preparing to shape the twenty-first century, much as the U.S. shaped the twentieth.”4 That competition for influence will be a global one, and Beijing believes with good reason that the next decade will likely determine the outcome.

- The book argues that the core of US-China competition since the Cold War has been over regional and now global order. ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=218))

- A hegemon’s position in regional and global order emerges from three broad “forms of control” that are used to regulate the behavior of other states: coercive capability (to force compliance), consensual inducements (to incentivize it), and legitimacy (to rightfully command it). ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=220))

- For rising states, the act of peacefully displacing the hegemon consists of two broad strategies generally pursued in sequence. The first strategy is to blunt the hegemon’s exercise of those forms of control, particularly those extended over the rising state; after all, no rising state can displace the hegemon if it remains at the hegemon’s mercy. The second is to build forms of control over others; indeed, no rising state can become a hegemon if it cannot secure the deference of other states through coercive threats, consensual inducements, or rightful legitimacy. ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=222))
- China’s first strategy of displacement (1989–2008) was to quietly blunt American power over China, particularly in Asia, and it emerged after the traumatic trifecta of Tiananmen Square, the Gulf War, and the Soviet collapse led Beijing to sharply increase its perception of US threat. China’s second strategy of displacement (2008–2016) sought to build the foundation for regional hegemony in Asia, and it was launched after the Global Financial Crisis led Beijing to see US power as diminished and emboldened it to take a more confident approach. Now, with the invocation of “great changes unseen in a century” following Brexit, President Trump’s election, and the coronavirus pandemic, China is launching a third strategy of displacement, one that expands its blunting and building efforts worldwide to displace the United States as the global leader. ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=234))
- If there are two paths to hegemony—a regional one and a global one—China is now pursuing both. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=270))
- Over a decade ago, Lee Kuan Yew—the visionary politician who built modern Singapore and personally knew China’s top leaders—was asked by an interviewer, “Are Chinese leaders serious about displacing the United States as the number one power in Asia and in the world?” He answered with an emphatic yes. “Of course. Why not?” he began, “They have transformed a poor society by an economic miracle to become now the second-largest economy in the world—on track . . . to become the world’s largest economy.” China, he continued, boasts “a culture 4,000 years old with 1.3 billion people, with a huge and very talented pool to draw from. How could they not aspire to be number one in Asia, and in time the world?” ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=271))
- China now poses a challenge unlike any the United States has ever faced. For more than a century, no US adversary or coalition of adversaries has reached 60 percent of US GDP. Neither Wilhelmine Germany during the First World War, the combined might of Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany during the Second World War, nor the Soviet Union at the height of its economic power ever crossed this threshold.10 And yet, this is a milestone that China itself quietly reached as early as 2014. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=283))
- This book defines grand strategy as a state’s theory of how it can achieve its strategic objectives that is intentional, coordinated, and implemented across multiple means of statecraft—military, economic, and political. ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=291))
- The coordination and long-term planning involved in grand strategy allow a state to punch above its weight; since China is already a heavyweight, if it has a coherent scheme that coordinates its $14 trillion economy with its blue-water navy and rising political influence around the world—and the United States either misses it or misunderstands it—the course of the twenty-first century may unfold in ways detrimental to the United States and the liberal values it has long championed. ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=301))
- Where analysts increasingly agree is on the idea that China’s recent assertiveness is a product of Chinese President Xi’s personality—a mistaken notion that ignores the long-standing Party consensus in which China’s behavior is actually rooted. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=309))
- this book argues that to identify the existence, content, and adjustment of China’s grand strategy, researchers must find evidence of (1) grand strategic concepts in authoritative texts; (2) grand strategic capabilities in national security institutions; and (3) grand strategic conduct in state behavior. Without such an approach, any analysis is more likely to fall victim to the kinds of natural biases in “perception and misperception” that often recur in assessments of other powers.29 ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=378))
- Security is defined here as “sovereignty [i.e., freedom of maneuver or autonomy], safety, territorial integrity, and power position—the last being the necessary means to the first three.”4 A grand strategy is a state’s theory of how it can achieve these security-related ends for itself that is intentional, coordinated, and implemented across multiple means of statecraft, such as military, economic, and political instruments. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=494))
- States must have a set of: (1)grand strategic concepts about how the ends, ways, and means of strategy fit together; (2)grand strategic capabilities in national security institutions to coordinate diverse instruments of statecraft to pursue national interests over parochial ones; and (3)grand strategic conduct that is ultimately consistent with a state’s strategic concepts. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=510))
- to find grand strategy we must look for “a coherent body of thought and action,” ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=535))
- grand strategies rest on perceptions of power and threat, and that shifts in these perceptions “are driven more by events, especially shocks, than statistical measures” like gradually changing GDP growth rates or fleet sizes.11 By comparing descriptions of power and threat in Chinese texts before and after foreign policy shocks—such as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, the Gulf War, the Soviet collapse, and the Global Financial Crisis, among others—one can determine whether perceptions of power and threat changed and produced strategic adjustment too. ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=566))
- Together, coercive capacity, consensual inducements, and legitimacy secure the deference of states within order. ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=589))
- Orders can change peacefully when their forms of control—coercive capability, consensual inducement, and legitimacy—are undermined, and they can strengthen when these forms of control are bolstered. These processes can occur gradually or all at once, but like the relatively peaceful collapse of the Soviet Union, they need not require war.17 ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=596))
- What matters is not whether a rising power like China has full regional hegemony but rather whether it has done enough blunting and building in its home region to have confidence that it can manage the risks of hegemonic intervention if it pursues global expansion. ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=622))
- Because the hegemon looms largest in the strategic calculations of a rising power, this book argues that the choice to “revise” order is based on perceptions of the hegemon. Two variables are critically important: (1) the size of the perceived relative power gap with an external hegemon, which refers broadly to the hegemon’s capacity to harm the interests of the rising power; and (2) the perceived threat from the external hegemon, which applies to the hegemon’s perceived willingness to use that power to cause harm.21 Defining these variables perceptually is critical because what is most relevant to strategic formulation is not an objective measure of power and threat (which is elusive in any case) but instead a state’s own assessment of a rival’s power and threat. ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=630))
- of the greatest advantages” of Leninist systems, he told his guests, “is that, as long as something has been decided and a resolution has been made, it can be carried out immediately without any restrictions.”2 Unlike the Americans, he declared, “our efficiency is higher; we carry things out as soon as we have made up our mind. . . . It is our strength, and we must retain this advantage.” ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=695))
- Like many future communists, Deng went abroad to study, and he explained his reasoning with an answer right out of Wei Yuan’s focus on “wealth and power”: “China was weak and we wanted to make her stronger, and China was poor and we wanted to make her richer. We went to the West in order to study and find a way to save China.” ([Location 770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=770))
- As Hu Jintao noted on the centennial of Mao’s birth, the Party is in a relay race toward rejuvenation. “History is a long river,” he declared. “Today developed from yesterday, and tomorrow is a continuation of today.”28 “The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the great ideal of Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, their comrades, and millions of revolutionary martyrs. . . . Today, the baton of history has reached our hands.”29 ([Location 815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=815))
- Before its fall under the Qing, Jiang noted, “China’s economic level was leading in the world” and “China’s economic aggregate ranked first in the world.”35 Accordingly, rejuvenation would involve “narrowing the gap with the world’s advanced level” and making China “wealthy and powerful” again.36 ([Location 838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=838))
- Hu Jintao quoted Sun Yat-sen to define rejuvenation’s global dimension: “if China becomes strong, we should not only restore our national status but also bear a big responsibility for the world,” adding that this would involve efforts to “promote the development of the international political and economic order in a more just and reasonable direction.”38 Rejuvenation, Hu made clear, would allow China to “stand in the forest of nations with an entirely new bearing.” ([Location 845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=845))
- Xi Jinping’s brash vision of mid-century rejuvenation is the product not simply of personality or parochialism but something more powerful: a nationalist Party consensus that stretches back through time to the self-strengthening focus of the late Qing reformists. The CCP has had its internal disagreements, struggles, factionalism, and extended descents into ideological extremism, but its founders and their successors have consistently understood it as the vehicle for rejuvenating China. ([Location 853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=853))
- China’s Communist Party is a Leninist party. The namesake of this political approach, Vladimir Lenin, believed a vanguard of professional revolutionaries with tightly centralized political power could reshape history. He was committed to the centralization of authority, and he repeatedly stressed that the “important principle of all Party organization and all Party activity” was “the greatest possible centralization” of leadership.42 Lenin’s Bolsheviks structured their party in this fashion, and when they seized power after the Russian Revolution, they built a Leninist fusion of the party and state that China imported almost wholesale. ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=866))
- Together, these institutions—the General Secretary, the Politburo Standing Committee, the Central Foreign Affairs Commission, and the Central Military Commission—run foreign policy. What is notable about this structure is how well suited it is for coordinated, top-down decision-making. Every key institution, particularly for foreign policy, is within the Party itself, has the General Secretary at its center, and sits above the state. Together, these factors provide these institutions the capability and the authority to bring together military, political, and economic instruments in coordination. ([Location 905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=905))
- It is of course not enough for the Party to merely coordinate and broadcast policy; it must also be able to ensure its implementation. As Lenin wrote in his discussion of political organization, “For the center . . . to actually direct the orchestra, it needs to know who plays which violin and where, who plays a false note and why, and how and where it is necessary to transfer someone to correct the dissonance.”57 ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=942))
- with leadership at the top and institutional penetration virtually all the way through to the bottom, the Party has the ability not only to coordinate and direct state behavior but in many cases to monitor it. This is by design. ([Location 952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=952))
- rather than be controlled by popular nationalism, the Party is often able to wield it as a tool—providing the state adequate autonomy in most cases to pursue grand strategy even when it conflicts with public sentiment. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=971))
- The question of whether one sees chaos or purpose in foreign policy can sometimes be about the level of analysis. ([Location 985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=985))
- For decades, China’s most authoritative foreign policy addresses delivered by its most senior leader—often to the assembled foreign policy apparatus—have repeatedly emphasized one common feature: that China’s grand strategy is set at the highest levels of the Party itself. This has long been the case, though the centralization has intensified under Xi. ([Location 991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=991))
- Five years later, at China’s sixth ever Foreign Affairs Work Conference, Xi expanded on these themes at surprising length, and his remarks are worthy of scrutiny. “Diplomacy is a concentrated representation of the will of the state,” he declared, “and diplomatic authority must stay with the CCP Central Committee” and its “centralized and unified leadership.”76 Across all foreign policy domains, he noted, “all must consciously maintain unity with the CCP Central Committee, ensuring strict enforcement of orders and prohibitions [令行禁止], and that all march in lockstep [步调统一].”77 The Party had formulated a long-term systematic strategy that others were expected to implement. “External work is a systematic project [系统工程]” that involved coordination among “political parties, governments, people’s congresses, the CPPCC, the military, localities, public, etc.”78 Through the synchronized labors of these groups “the party takes overall responsibility and coordinates the foreign work of each group to ensure that the CCP Central Committee’s foreign policy guidelines, policies, and strategies, and plans are implemented.”79 Here, Xi was listing a rough hierarchy of CCP policy dictates and the various parts of the state, society, and Party expected to advance them. Finally, Xi also focused on the people involved in foreign policy. “After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor,” he noted, “so we must build a strong contingent of foreign affairs personnel that are loyal to the CPC, the country and the people.”80 His speech emphasized Party control over foreign policy institutions and Party-building within them—which these loyal individuals would advance. ([Location 1024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=1024))
- Since the end of the Cold War, however, it has been challenging for nonexpert Western observers to focus much on the Party. The institution is alien, its institutions seem obsolete, and its texts are often stale and wooden. And yet, those institutions are an extraordinarily powerful vehicle for Chinese nationalism and for coordinating grand strategy and providing the state some autonomy from society. Those texts too provide a unique window into an otherwise secretive organization. And a look at both can help illustrate the contours of China’s grand strategy. ([Location 1154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=1154))
- The stations at Korla and Qitai were physical proof of something that now seems hard to believe: the United States and China were once quasi-allies. Over the course of the 1980s, Washington worked with Beijing to oppose the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and Soviet influence in Southeast Asia. It sold China weapons, including “artillery equipment and ammunition, antisubmarine torpedoes, artillery-locating radar, advanced avionics, and Blackhawk helicopters.”3 And it even permitted its allies to sell China an old carrier hull for study—one that was complete with a steam catapult, arresting equipment, and mirror landing systems.4 China’s leaders welcomed these ties. ([Location 1173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=1173))
- All of this changed abruptly following what this book calls the “traumatic trifecta” of Tiananmen Square (1989), the Gulf War (1990–1991), and the Soviet collapse (1991). These three short but historic years reshaped the United States, China, and the international system, and each heightened Beijing’s anxieties about the United States. The Tiananmen Square protests reminded Beijing of the American ideological threat, the swift Gulf War victory reminded it of the American military threat, and loss of the shared Soviet adversary reminded it of the American geopolitical threat. In short order, the United States quickly replaced the Soviet Union as China’s primary security concern, that in turn led to a new grand strategy, and a thirty-year struggle to displace American power was born. ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=1183))
- Before Scowcroft’s visit, President George H. W. Bush had sent an apologetic and solicitous secret letter to Deng Xiaoping on the importance of bilateral ties; now, Scowcroft would carry a similar message in person to reassure China’s paramount leader that despite the tough measures the United States was forced by public opinion to take in response to China’s crackdown, Washington would keep its actions limited to preserve the relationship. ([Location 1225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=1225))
- A decade later, Scowcroft reflected on these meetings and noted the challenge he faced in reassuring Beijing. “I explained over and over again . . . how our system worked, but I think they never really believed it,” he said of his attempt to explain the split between Congress and the Bush administration on Tiananmen sanctions.14 The difference in culture and political systems “had created a wide divide between us,” and while “they were focused on security and stability,” Scowcroft observed, “we were interested in freedom and human rights.”15 It was precisely this ideological gap—with liberal values posing a danger to the CCP—that had made the United States too threatening to Beijing and that made Beijing too difficult to reassure. ([Location 1240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=1240))
- The sentiment became a common feature of Deng’s remarks, even his public ones. “The West really wants unrest in China,” Deng declared later that same month, “it wants turmoil not only in China but also in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The United States and some other Western countries are trying to bring about a peaceful evolution towards capitalism in socialist countries.”25 In Deng’s mind, this threat to China was a form of warfare. “The United States has coined an expression: waging a world war without gunsmoke,” he argued. “We should be on guard against this. Capitalists want to defeat socialists in the long run. In the past they used weapons, atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, but they were opposed by the peoples of the world. So now they are trying peaceful evolution.” ([Location 1280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=1280))
- And yet, Jiang argued before the assembled diplomats, there was a second side to US policy toward China. “On the other hand, the United States out of consideration for its own global strategy and its fundamental economic interests, will have to focus on our country’s vast market and has no choice but to seek cooperation with us in international affairs.”40 In other words, Jiang argued, Washington “needs to maintain normal relations with us.”41 Even so, China could not adopt an overtly confrontational strategy because, as Jiang observed, “The United States is our principal export market and an important source for our imported capital, technology, and advanced management experience.”42 Instead, “protecting and developing Sino-U.S. relations was of strategic significance” to China. By cooperating with the United States in some areas and avoiding confrontation in others, China could minimize US antipathy, continue to develop economically, and increase its relative power. ([Location 1345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=1345))
- Tao Guang Yang Hui was a shorthand that referred to a longer twenty-four-character admonition from Deng: China should “observe calmly, secure our position, cope with affairs calmly, hide our capabilities and bide our time, maintain a low profile, never claim leadership, and accomplish something.”69 This was a conscious strategy of non-assertiveness. China did not pursue region-building enterprises that might unsettle the United States; instead, it focused on non-assertively blunting the foundations of US power. ([Location 1463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=1463))
- before the trifecta, Chinese leaders in the late 1980s had been turning their attention to local wars and territorial disputes, and China began long-term plans for a naval and air structure focused on sea control that was designed to hold distant maritime territory. But once the United States became a threat, Beijing jettisoned that strategy in favor of one focused on sea denial to prevent the US military from traversing or controlling the waters near China. ([Location 1690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=1690))
- When we study military investments, there are least four indicators that are important, and variation within them, across them, and between them as well as comparisons with other countries can together be leveraged to dismiss certain theories of Chinese behavior and validate others. These include (1) acquisition, or what China acquired and when; (2) doctrine, or which sets of institutionalized principles about how to fight China adopted; (3) force posture, or how and where China deploys its military; and (4) training, or how and for what kinds of conflict China prepares its forces to fight. ([Location 1714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=1714))
- From Beijing’s perspective, the Gulf War was a vision into a frightening future where US high-technology weapons could be wielded against China’s outdated forces, and therefore a catalyst for changing strategy, ([Location 1772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=1772))
- In the years after the trifecta, China’s strategy cohered into an effort to develop asymmetric weapons to blunt American power. ([Location 1795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=1795))
- To deal with this concerning state of affairs, Chi’s speech recommended that China find a way to defeat a stronger opponent under high-tech conditions. Iraq failed to adopt these asymmetric strategies, Chi noted, and “this makes us once again deeply feel that if countries that have inferior weapons want to effectively defeat stronger countries,” then they need to plan accordingly. He went on: “The real effective way [to deal with a superior opponent] is still what Chairman Mao said, you fight your way, I fight my way. In other words, you have your advanced technology, I have my own set of inferior equipment to deal with your approach.” ([Location 1854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=1854))
- Huaqing reiterated the central leadership’s conclusions: “our viewpoint is . . . [that] any hi-tech weapon system has its own weaknesses and we can always find ways to overcome it” and that “our military, poorly equipped as they were [in past conflicts], used to triumph over better equipped enemies. This fine tradition will still play a role in future hi-tech wars.”52 In an unmistakable reference to the United States, he wrote, “The modernization of armies in the countries which pursue hegemony is mainly based on the development of long-range offensive weapons and aimed at carrying out global combat operations.” ([Location 1893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=1893))
- Zhang then noted that “the third step, also a key step, is to come up with our own countermeasures, everyone has their strong points and their weak points [寸有所长，尺有所短], high-tech weapons have limitations, and we can always find ways to deal with them.” ([Location 1944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=1944))
- After the trifecta, China overinvested in three capabilities that are useful primarily for denial as part of its blunting strategy: submarines, missiles, and mines. It built the world’s largest submarine fleet, the world’s largest stockpile of sea mines, and the world’s first anti-ship ballistic missile. China’s pursuit of these capabilities during the 1990s and early 2000s stands in sharp contrast to its contemporaneous underinvestment in carrier aviation, anti-submarine warfare, anti-air warfare, mine countermeasures, and amphibious warfare, and it is not explainable through any of the theories offered at the chapter’s outset, including diffusion-based theories and adoption capacity theories. ([Location 2012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=2012))
- Symmetric advantage occurs when both the enemy and our forces have the same kind of combat capabilities, and when we have the same fundamental quality, so that confronting the enemy takes the form of requiring numerical superiority. With respect to asymmetric advantage . . . If the enemy has combat capabilities that we lack, we must use other means that can defeat the enemy and win in order to create an asymmetric advantage, such as having the necessary number of cruise missiles, submarines, and mines against an aircraft carrier, which together makes up an asymmetric strike advantage.82 ([Location 2023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=2023))
- China sought to use submarines to blunt American power. China’s focus on submarines came not from bottom-up submariner pressure but a top-down belief that submarines should be prioritized as part of an asymmetric strategy to thwart US carriers and surface vessels in the region. This is clear across several aspects of China’s behavior. ([Location 2070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=2070))
- The kinds of submarines China built in this period are also revealing. Why did China prioritize diesel submarines with air-independent propulsion (AIP) over nuclear ones?93 Diesel submarines are quieter than nuclear submarines even though they travel shorter distances. They are also an asymmetric tool and vastly cheaper than the US nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers they threaten. As one PLAN officer noted, “the price of a nuclear submarine can buy several, even more than ten, conventional submarines.”94 For this reason, although China could build more nuclear submarines, it chose not to and opted for a Soviet-style denial-focused navy that mixed diesel and nuclear submarines, in contrast to the all-nuclear submarine focus the US fields. ([Location 2083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=2083))
- These were large and expensive vessels—the Princeton alone cost $1 billion—and they had been laid low by Iraqi mines that each cost no more than a few thousand dollars. By some estimates, there were still roughly 1,000 more mines in the northern Gulf, demonstrating the asymmetric advantages of mine warfare against a superior American foe.103 ([Location 2130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=2130))
- The U.S. will need to move supplies by sea. But China is not Iraq. China has advanced sea mines. . . . This is a fatal threat to U.S. seaborne transport. . . . [T]he moment conflict erupted in the Taiwan Strait, the PLA Navy could deploy mines. U.S. ships that want to conduct ASW [anti-submarine warfare] [would] have to first sweep the area clear. When the U.S. fought in the Gulf War, it took over half a year to sweep all Iraq’s sea mines. Therefore, it [would] not be easy for the U.S. military to sweep all the mines that the PLA [might] lay.109 ([Location 2168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=2168))
- Chinese sources routinely write that mines are both “high and low technology” [高低技术], with a typical reference noting that mines in the Gulf War cost as little as $10,000 but did over $96 million in damage to US vessels.

- Since the end of the Cold War, the aircraft carrier has become a symbol of the might of a great power, while the ballistic missile has also become an effective weapon for developing countries around the world to safeguard their own security and challenge great powers. The might of an aircraft carrier is based on the disparity between the comprehensive powers of rich and poor states. The ballistic missile, on the other hand, seeks to exploit the temporal lag in the development of offensive and defensive technologies. . . . ASBMs are undoubtedly an effective means of deterring military intervention at the present [though perhaps not in the long-term].132 ([Location 2268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=2268))
- [ASBMs] provide China with more maneuvering space for military and political strategic operations on its eastern, maritime flank. . . [The creation of a] tactical ballistic missile maritime strike system . . . will establish for China in any high-intensity conflict in its coastal waters an asymmetry, in its favor, in the deliverance of firepower and so will remedy to some extent China’s qualitative inferiority in traditional naval platforms. Further, the existence of this asymmetry would set up for both sides a psychological “upper limit” on the scale of the conflict. This would enable both parties to return more easily “to rationality,” thereby creating more space for maneuver in the resolution of maritime conflicts.134 ([Location 2279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=2279))
- China’s strategic admonitions not to emulate Western states, to defeat the strong with the weapons of the weak, and to acquire shashoujian weapons all seem to point to a decision to avoid expensive platforms like a carrier that would in any case be inferior to the Western equivalent and to instead focus on different capabilities. ([Location 2434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=2434))
- the decision to acquire an aircraft carrier would have meant committing not only to a specific naval force structure, but to a broader military structure that was not suited to blunting. As one PLA textbook makes clear, “whether we should go ahead with a carrier project is not a naval question. It is related to the question of how to adjust our overall force posture and national defense policy.”167 And that is precisely why a carrier would have been an imprudent decision for a grand strategy focused on the United States.

- China joined and stalled regional organizations to blunt American order-building and create security for itself. Concerned about growing US influence in the region, Beijing undermined the institutionalization of organizations that included the United States like APEC and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) but was more supportive of institutionalization in those that excluded the United States and gave China a major role, like ASEAN Plus Three (APT) and the SCO—both of which it helped launch. ([Location 2504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=2504))
- American power and China’s dependence on “the U.S. market, capital, and technology” prevented Beijing from openly opposing Washington; accordingly, regional organizations became an important part of China’s quieter security strategy.

- “In the future, the greatest challenge to China’s security,” he argued, “is how to deal with and address the comprehensive changes in its relationships [with neighbors] caused by the rise in its own power.” If this challenge were mishandled, Zhang feared that China would “push itself into a circle of hostility” surrounded by unfriendly states. In Zhang’s mind, “the most dangerous situation is the formation of many countries united together to counter China, to carry out the encirclement and containment of China.” ([Location 2590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=2590))
- China has pursued a strategy of maintaining amicable relationships with neighbors (mulin youhao, wending zhoubian) to hedge against downturns in Sino-U.S. relations. Deng Xiaoping and his successors understand clearly that, with more than fifteen countries bordering China, an aggressive posture is simply not in China’s interest, no matter how powerful China becomes, because aggression would lead to a counterbalancing alliance of China’s neighbors and a distant power (the United States). If, however, China adopts a defensive realist approach, most regional countries would be reluctant to adopt a policy of hard containment, and thus China would likely enjoy a benign regional security environment. To this end, China has made strenuous efforts to improve its relationships with its neighboring countries, sometimes by making significant concessions despite strong domestic opposition.22 ([Location 2624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=2624))
- “Here, I want to emphasize one point. The United States is located in the Western Hemisphere. Although it is not our neighbor, it is a key factor affecting the security environment in our country.”31 The purpose of China’s peripheral diplomacy, at this stage, was not to build China-led order in the region but to dissuade its neighbors from joining with the United States to encircle China.

- After the United States sought to elevate APEC at Seattle, Wang observed that “US strategic intent became quite obvious. Its ‘community’ concept encompasses three pillars: namely economic integration based on trade liberalization; multilateral security mechanisms dominated by the United States; and democratization with American values as the standard.”59 He continued, “The establishment of such a ‘community’ and its vision, of course . . . is something that cannot be accepted by China.”60 And so China sought to prevent the emergence of such a community by weakening APEC itself.

- China not only criticized alliances, it sought to use ASEAN institutions to frustrate the US military’s freedom of maneuver. China proposed requiring prior notification of all joint exercises and allowing observer participation—requirements that effectively only applied to the United States as the main state conducting joint exercises, and succeeded in inserting prior notification into the 2002 Declaration of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.128 China also called for states to cease surveillance of one another, which again principally applied to US maritime surveillance.129 It used discussions over the South China Sea as “a means to restrict US Naval exercises in the area” by proposing a ban on South China Sea military exercises—targeting recently restarted US-Philippine exercises in particular.

- Following the Soviet collapse and then surging US involvement in the region after 9/11, both Moscow and Beijing feared that the United States might fill the void in Central Asia. As China’s State Councilor Dai Bingguo later wrote in his memoirs, China needed to “engage the Shanghai Cooperation Organization” in order to “help change the power imbalance” with the West.

- China’s creation of the SCO—as the meeting between Vladimir Putin and Chi Haotian suggests—was less about combating the “three evils” and more about blunting and preempting American power within the region and laying the foundation for Chinese order-building on China’s periphery. All of this flowed from Beijing’s perception of the US threat. ([Location 3118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=3118))
- once US power was perceived as declining, the SCO’s 2009 statement declared the “tendency towards genuine multipolarity has become irreversible” and that the “role of the regional aspect in the settlement of global problems is on the rise.”157 Regional great powers, in other words, could now push back on Western hegemony and expand their freedom of maneuver. ([Location 3138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=3138))
- For China, those intentions were dangerous. Luo Gan, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, fretted that “the US wants to use the war in Afghanistan to have a permanent military force in Central Asia, which will have a big impact on our national security.”163 In a meeting with the Central Military Commission in 2001, Jiang Zemin placed China’s fears of the “three evils” on par with concerns over the US role in Central Asia: “After the end of the Cold War, Central Asia saw the emergence of two prominent circumstances. The first was the ‘three evils’ and the second was the American military presence.”164 China feared a US or NATO presence in each regional state would neutralize the SCO’s security role and could grow into something institutionalized, perhaps even an expanded NATO.165 One Chinese scholar feared that “NATO’s eastward expansion may get right up to China’s western border.”166 Others feared encirclement, noting that China now faced an American presence in the West in addition to the presence in the East.167 ([Location 3156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=3156))
- The SCO was an effort for China to use what many consider liberal instruments of order-building, such as multilateral institutions, to advance goals that were fundamentally related to China’s power and to China’s strategic interests. This kind of “strategic liberalism” was not restricted only to the institutional realm but was also a feature of the economic one. As the next chapter shows, China saw economic instruments as ways to constrain US power over China and to cultivate the “wealth and power” that had been the focus of Chinese nationalists for generations.

- At the 3rd Plenum, Deng elevated the “four modernizations”—a concept that focused on modernizing agriculture, industry, defense, and science and technology. “The crux of the four modernizations,” Deng declared earlier that year, “is the mastery of modern science and technology. Without that it is impossible to build modern agriculture, modern industry, or national defense.” ([Location 3330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=3330))
- Hu Jintao shared Jiang Zemin’s concern about US economic leverage and broadened it from markets, capital, and technology to resources and trade flows. Shortly after taking power, Hu gave an important speech identifying the “Malacca Dilemma”—China’s reliance on the Strait of Malacca—and stating that some great powers, such as the United States, sought to control that chokepoint and the resources upon which China’s surging economy increasingly depended. Hu saw American ill intentions throughout the global economy: “China’s overseas oil and gas resource development, its cross-border mergers and acquisitions, and its importation of advanced technology have been continuously suffering from interference. This is because of the willful instigation and malicious sensationalization of some people,” presumably Americans, though Hu allowed that “in some cases there is an actual conflict of interests” rather than political maneuvering.

- China’s concessions were largely a product of its weakness and dependence on the capitalist West to propel its development forward. By the early 2000s, it was clear that China had played its weak hand well in the negotiations over PNTR and WTO. China had bought itself stable market access abroad, which in turn made multinational companies more willing to invest in and export from China—setting off a virtuous cycle of explosive growth in China while accelerating deindustrialization and increasing unemployment in the industrialized world.

- That move at such a high-profile forum was a major sign that China was changing its grand strategy. China was no longer interested only in blunting American power.

- China’s discourse on multipolarity took off in the post–Cold War era, and the term was less frequently included in Party texts before it. For example, virtually no Party Congress report before the Cold War’s conclusion referenced multipolarity, but after the trifecta of Tiananmen, the Gulf War, and the Soviet collapse, every single report included it—often at the report’s outset and in its foreign policy section, suggesting the term’s importance to strategy.

- Two years after Hu’s landmark speech, China outlined the concept of a “Community of Common Destiny” in a White Paper that focused on China’s foreign policy. The discussion of the term provided insight into what China’s order-building would mean in practice. China’s preference was for an Asia where others were dependent on China economically and divorced from US alliances militarily, and the concept was defined in such terms.

- In sum, the acquisition timeline shows the post-crisis shift to a carrier-based navy was rapid, with China promptly ending decades of constraints on its carrier program and working so furiously that within a decade it had two completed carriers, one near completion, one more under construction, and nuclear-powered carriers in planning.

- As early as 1970, Xiao Jingguang, the first commander of the PLAN, had said, “the Chinese Navy needs aircraft carriers: if a fleet is active in the open sea without an aircraft carrier, there is no air supremacy, and without air supremacy, there is no victory.”58 In 1973, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai linked carriers to China’s maritime sovereignty: “Our Nansha and Xisha Islands are occupied by the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam); without an aircraft carrier, we cannot put China’s Navy at risk [by] fighting,” as China’s Navy would be left “to fight just with bayonets.”59 ([Location 4682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=4682))

- In sum, China avoided building an aircraft carrier despite its manifest ability and strategic interests in doing so because it was pursuing a blunting strategy and knew carriers would send the wrong signal to the United States and to China’s neighbors—all while remaining extremely vulnerable to attack. After the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, China began to emphasize building regional order. It no longer felt the need to constrain itself for fear of rattling Washington or the wider region. The capabilities that carriers were known for were now fully in line with China’s own strategic objectives, which leaned increasingly toward enforcing maritime sovereignty and cultivating the ability to intervene regionally. And so, China entered the ranks of carrier-fielding great powers. ([Location 4735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=4735))

- By 2015, trade settlement in RMB reached $1.1 trillion—30 percent of China’s total trade—from virtually zero in 2000.72 If this percentage increases, it partly reduces China’s vulnerability to US structural power because China will increasingly be able to settle trade in its own currency. At the same time, however, the development should not be overstated. The fact that China uses RMB in settling its own trade does not mean the RMB is becoming a widely accepted medium for international transactions, which limits China’s own ability to exercise structural power over others. Data from SWIFT suggests that the RMB accounts for only between 1 and 2 percent of all international payments, and while SWIFT data is not reflective of all transactions worldwide (especially those denominated in RMB), it nonetheless provides a useful estimate.

- If much of Asia becomes an effective renminbi zone in the next decade or more, then some of the instruments of American financial power could be wielded by China against its neighbors. Those neighbors would need access to the renminbi system, payments infrastructure like CIPS and CNAPS, and Chinese banks—all of which China can control. An era of Chinese financial statecraft and sanctions within Asia, though perhaps not globally, may not be so distant, and may in turn lay the foundation for a sphere of influence within Asia. In this way, a Chinese financial zone in Asia would be layered over the US financial order worldwide. ([Location 6000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=6000))

- SWIFT is a standard-setting and messaging institution with a network that makes cross-border financial payments possible, thereby constituting the sub-structure of global finance. The organization, known as the Society for World Interbank Financial Telecommunication, was founded in 1973 when 239 banks from fifteen different countries created unified messaging standards, a messaging platform, and a network to route messages.77 According to the organization, SWIFT became the nodal financial messaging system with “the connection of the first central banks in 1983,” which “reinforced SWIFT’s position as the common link between all parties in the financial industry.”78 SWIFT promptly replaced Telex, a slow and error-prone patchwork manual system with conflicting standards that effectively required banks to work in several contradictory formats to make payments. Today, SWIFT spans 200 countries and more than 10,000 institutions, it facilitates 15 million messages daily, and is the essential infrastructure that makes international payments possible. Importantly, SWIFT is a messaging service and does not engage in clearing and settling, so no money flows through it—only messages that make money transfers possible. Clearance and settling often occur through US services like Fedwire (which makes payments between bank accounts at the Federal Reserve) and CHIPS (which is privately owned and engages in “netting” to capture the total differences in transactions between two banks in a given day), as well as a variety of other services.

- Although SWIFT is a messaging service and does not engage in clearing and settling, if a bank is cut off from the network, it is essentially cut off from the global financial system and from much of the clearing and settling infrastructure that exists.

- The People’s Bank of China—with approval from the Chinese government—began developing its own alternative to SWIFT for financial messaging and interbank payments as early as 2013, roughly one year after the West cut off Iran.86 This system, known as the China International Payments System (CIPS), would not only insulate China from financial pressure but also increase its own autonomy, giving it sovereign control over all information that passes through its network, the power to help others bypass sanctions, and the ability to one day cut others off from China’s system. Moreover, the ambition for CIPS exceeds that for SWIFT: the former would not only be a messaging service like SWIFT but will also provide clearance and settlement—that is, full integration of the payments process. Unlike Russian elites, China’s elites have been far less obvious in telegraphing their system’s possibility as a rival to SWIFT; nevertheless, its strategic potential is real, if still somewhat distant.

- As one person involved with CIPS noted, the system was launched without all these features but there was “ambition” for more: “[CIPS] doesn’t include a lot of things [yet], but there is pressure for delivery.”92 Eventually, the system is intended to “allow offshore banks to participate, enabling offshore-to-offshore renminbi payments as well as those in and out of China.”93 This would make CIPS a wholly independent financial infrastructure and provide any two parties anywhere in the world a method for messaging, clearance, and settlement entirely free from US review, which would seriously undermine US financial power worldwide.

Although Washington lacks the ability to directly control these credit raters or manipulate their ratings, China views them as tools of direct or indirect American power corrupted by political bias. At the 2010 G20 summit in Toronto, President Hu Jintao called for the countries to “develop an objective, fair, reasonable, and uniformed method and standard for sovereign credit rating,” demonstrating that the issue had received top-level political attention.

If the United States controls this “rating discourse power,” then China “will lose financial sovereignty.” Worse, the “rating discourse power can be manipulated . . . in an effort to erode the social basis of the ruling party.” In contrast, the 2008 Global Financial Crisis offered “a great historical opportunity for China to strive for international rating discourse power.”100 China’s ratings, even if they do not gain overwhelming market share, could nonetheless pressure the “big three” to adjust their ratings and “converge” toward China’s, an outcome Guan welcomes.101 ([Location 6137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=6137))

In 2016, a year before Xi’s Party Congress address, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union and Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. From China’s perspective—which is highly sensitive to changes in perceptions of American power—these two events were shocking. The world’s most powerful democracies were withdrawing from the international order they had helped erect, creating what China’s leadership and foreign policy elite has called a “period of historical opportunity” [历史机遇期] to expand the country’s strategic focus from Asia to the wider globe and its governance systems.

- Behind these bold pronouncements stood thousands of papers on Western decline from China’s top academics. The papers showcase China’s own biases, including a tendency to focus on the “base structure” of the economy which flows from Marxist theory, to see diversity as weakness given China’s relative homogeneity, and to see information flows as dangerous given China’s own illiberalism. Most papers tell a similar if simplistic causal story: the West’s forty-year experiment with “neoliberal” economic policies exacerbated economic inequality and ethnic strife, which in turn produced populist waves that paralyzed the state—all amplified by a freewheeling Western information environment. These are not the views of a handful of obscure experts, but so common as to be consensus. Xi Jinping may never tell this story in public, but it is undoubtedly one he and his fellow Party elites believe about the United States—and it is why they are now emboldened.

- A brief tour of China’s discourse on American decline can be instructive. The story often begins with economic inequality. After the 1970s, writes Deputy Dean at Beijing Foreign Studies University Xie Tao, “neoliberalism was in the dominant position” and governments put “economic freedom first, advocated tax cuts, and paid less attention to social inequality.”31 Jin Canrong, a well-known professor and dean at Renmin University, argued this “neoliberalism” wave began with the “Thatcher Revolution in 1979 and the Reagan Revolution in 1980” and led to “a division between the rich and poor.”32 The economic structure changed too. Nie Wenjuan, deputy director of the Institute of International Relations at China Foreign Affairs University, argued that, “With its democratic society, the US is unable to prevent financial capitalism from swelling, or to take dramatic action against vested interests,” which causes stagnation and inequality.33 Wu Baiyi, an America Institute director at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, emphasized these forces “hollowed out” the US economy, with success in the technology and financial services industries coming at the expense of exports and traditional industry.34 ([Location 6378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=6378))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Jin Canrong argued that the culmination of these trends was illiberalism and dysfunction: “the polarization of the rich and the poor leads to widespread dissatisfaction in the lower and middle classes. The dissatisfaction in the lower and middle classes will surely brew populist politics on the left and right. Populist politics will inevitably be used by strong men. This is an inevitable result.”40 Chinese scholars point to the Tea Party movement in 2009, Occupy Wall Street in 2011, and particularly Brexit and Trump in 2016 as evidence of populism’s hold.41 ([Location 6402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=6402))

- According to Wu Baiyi, the economic calamity, social unrest, and poor COVID-19 response meant that “the country that has bragged about being ‘a light on a hill’ has sunk into sustained social unrest. . . . Chaos and division are suffocating the people.”46 Accordingly, a former vice president of the Central Party School argued, the pandemic would “certainly promote the further development of great changes unseen in a century.”47 Yuan Peng argued that America’s poor response to COVID-19 “is a blow to America’s soft and hard power, and America’s international influence has suffered a serious decline.”48 ([Location 6419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=6419))

- Wu Baiyi argued that the United States faced a great “American disease” that he likened to the “Dutch disease” and “Latin American disease” used to describe other dysfunctional states. Observers could no longer “cherish fantasies about the US capacity for self-rectification”: the economic pie was shrinking, “general manufacturing” had “withered,” good jobs were rarer, exports were falling, and the economy was tilted toward technology and financial services—all of which increased inequality while “narrowing channels for upward mobility.” ([Location 6438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=6438))

- Political institutions were failing too: “No matter whether the public support for a certain bill is 30 percent or 100 percent, it has no influence on whether it passes or fails” because of polarization, so no progress is made on the sources of US dysfunction.

- in a October 2018 interview, Yan Xuetong declared, “I think this is the best period of strategic opportunity for China since the end of the Cold War.”72 Explaining his logic, Yan argued, “Trump has ruined the US-led alliance system and improved China’s international environment. . . . In a strategic sense, China’s international environment is much better than before Trump came to power.”73 He put the situation in historical context: “In short, compared with the Korean War in the 1950s, the Vietnam War in the 1960s, and international sanctions in the 1990s, China’s current international difficulties are very small, and the gap between China and the United States is much smaller than before.”74 His overall point: “What matters most now is how China should take advantage of this strategic opportunity.75 Others had a similar perspective. Wu Xinbo notes that the Trump administration had been “constantly retreating” internationally, from “the withdrawal from TPP, the Paris Agreement on climate change, UNESCO, the Universal Postal Union, the termination of the JCPOA with Iran, the threat of withdrawal from the WTO, slamming NATO and even the UN, withdrawing from the INF treaty, announcing the withdrawal of troops from Syria, etc. It seems that the United States cannot help but give up its position in the post-war order.” “De-Americanization,” Wu Xinbo argued, “objectively creates a window of opportunity for various regions and countries to reposition themselves and solve various historical problems.” When the United States declines, the “delegation of its powers and loosening of its restrictions” can also bring people unexpected strategic dividends and benefits.”76 ([Location 6517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=6517))

- in recent years, China assembled coalitions of like-minded countries to support its authoritarian domestic policies that could, in the future, become more operational and active. For example, in 2019 and 2020 liberal democracies organized some twenty states to sign three separate statements and letters critical of China’s policies in Xinjiang and then Hong Kong. In response, China organized more than fifty states to sign three separate letters that supported China’s “remarkable achievements in the field of human rights” and expressed “ ‘firm opposition’ to relevant countries’ practice of politicizing human rights issues.”38 In all three cases, a comparison of the letters’ signatories reveals geographic and ideological differences between the two groups, with BRI signatories and many of China’s trading partners signing onto its letters, and liberal democracies and European states composing a bulk of the other camp. Beijing’s objective is to globalize China’s approach to human rights. As the People’s Daily put it, with fifty countries supporting China and only twenty critical of China, it was clear that Washington was standing “on the opposite side of international society.”39 These loose coalitions could collaborate on other normative issues in the future.

- Beijing now sees technology as central to its ambitions to displace American order. A key component of China’s “great changes unseen in a century” is the belief that the world is experiencing a new wave of technological innovation sometimes referred to as the “Fourth Industrial Revolution” that offers an opportunity for China to overtake the West. This term, originally developed at the World Economic Forum in 2015, has now been adopted by Beijing and generally refers to a wide range of technologies: artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, smart manufacturing, biotechnology, and even sovereign digital currencies, among many others. Beijing believes that technology’s intersection with supply chains, trade patterns, financial power, and information flows has the potential to reshape order alongside traditional economic instruments more central to past eras of Chinese grand strategy. For that reason, economic instruments—and technology in particular—are increasingly at the center of the US-China contest over global order.

- Most references to the “great changes unseen in a century” evoke the idea that waves of technological transformation have occasionally reshaped history. As Xi Jinping argued in a 2018 speech, “From the mechanization of the first industrial revolution in the 18th century, to the electrification of the second industrial revolution in the 19th century, to the informatization of the third industrial revolution in the 20th century,” each round of “disruptive technological innovation” has reshaped the world.49 Now, China was facing a fourth industrial revolution, and over the next decade, it had an opportunity to seize technology leadership. “The next ten years will be a key decade . . . for the world economy,” Xi argued. “A new round of technological revolution and industrial change, such as in artificial intelligence, big data, quantum information, and biotechnology, are gathering strength” and bringing “earth-shaking changes” while offering an “important opportunity to promote leapfrog development,” bypassing legacy systems and overtaking competitors.50 ([Location 6811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=6811))

- Beijing missed out on these revolutions, but now it hopes to ride the fourth industrial revolution to global leadership.

- For example, a typical and authoritative commentary on the subject posted online at the Study Times roughly two months after Xi’s 2018 address on the Fourth Industrial Revolution is clear on the geopolitical stakes of these technological changes. “The driving force for the great changes is the decisive role of productivity,” it argued.52 “Britain seized the opportunity of the first industrial revolution” provided by coal and steam technology and “established an empire on which the sun never set.”53 Afterward, “the United States seized the dominant power of advanced productivity from Great Britain” by dominating the second industrial revolution of electrification and promptly “jumped into position as the world’s number one industrial power, laying a solid foundation for establishing global hegemony.”54 Then, “the third industrial revolution originated in the United States,” and by seizing this digital revolution, the United States boosted its “comprehensive strength” and extended American hegemony.55 The arrival of the Fourth Industrial Revolution now offers an opportunity to make up for lost time.

Even as countries around the world sought to diversify away from China following COVID-19, President Xi declared that protecting China’s role in global supply chains was one of his top national priorities. These chains are one reason some scholars like Jin Canrong argue that “China has a greater chance of winning” the Fourth Industrial Revolution.74 Although the United States does have “the best innovation capabilities,” he argues, the country now “has a major problem, which is the hollowing out of its industrial base.”75 This means it “cannot turn technology into a product acceptable to the market” without China’s factories. “China has just about every industry” and its “manufacturing industry will account for more than 50 percent of the world’s total by 2030.”76 The country’s superior numbers of engineers, its ability to reverse-engineer, and its factories’ centrality to global technology are “China’s real advantage in long-term industrial competition.”77 China should press this advantage. “Regardless of how the United States feels,” he argues, “China . . . must work hard to seize the Fourth Industrial Revolution” and become the “leader” of it.78 For now, China is retaining its hold on global supply chains despite foreign pressure.

- China’s global military posture may not resemble the American variant. Beijing may lack alliance networks and bases with tens of thousands of soldiers and eschew costly interventions. It is more likely to opt for dual-use facilities, rotational access, and a lighter footprint—at least for now—when its military still faces difficulties in challenging the United States outside of the Indo-Pacific. This approach has drawbacks, but it might allow Beijing to better secure its interests, provide public security goods, and in some cases, position itself as a leader.

- “The United States has to be as good as or better than its opponent in the effectiveness with which resources are used, now that [they] are spending comparable resources.” —Andrew Marshall, Director of the Office of Net Assessment, 1973 ([Location 7075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=7075))

    - Note: The US government needs to be made significantly more efficient in order to compete with China now that our absolute resource advantage has dwindled
- this chapter advocates for a strategy focused on blunting Chinese power and order and building the foundations for US power and order. In many places, and particularly with respect to blunting, this strategy is intended to be asymmetric and draws partly from China’s own grand strategy in the 1990s and early 2000s. The United States cannot compete with China symmetrically—that is, dollar-for-dollar, ship-for-ship, or loan-for-loan—in part because of China’s sheer relative size. Asymmetric approaches to blunting seek to frustrate the effects—and, in some cases, the sources—of Chinese power and influence at lower cost than China expends in generating them. The building component of this strategy is more symmetric, but it generally seeks to invest in the foundations for US order, particularly when the coercive, consensual, or legitimacy benefits dramatically exceed the cost of investment and in virtually all cases where doing do so is cheaper than China’s own efforts to blunt US order. This strategic approach would seek to compete with China not through internal change or efforts at reassurance but by limiting China’s ability to convert its power into regional and global order. In this effort, the United States has certain advantages that flow from the ability of its open system to attract resources and talent, its network of alliances that China cannot yet split or replicate, and its geographic distance from rival great powers. Even so, its advantages are not inexhaustible, and the United States must compete cost-effectively. ([Location 7109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=7109))

- His report, entitled Long-Term Competition with the Soviets: A Framework for Strategic Analysis, circulated around the Pentagon that year. Marshall noted that to compete effectively with rising Soviet spending, “the United States has to be as good as or better than its opponent in the effectiveness with which resources are used now that the Soviets are spending comparable resources.”2 The key was to take actions that imposed a cost on the opponent greater than the cost of the action itself, which in turn required identifying areas of American and adversary advantage and disadvantage.

- Nothing in the preceding discussion of order, however, requires that order change only through war; in fact, order can also change through peacetime competition. An order weakens when the preceding forms of control—coercion, consent, and legitimacy—are undermined; conversely, an order strengthens when these same forms of control are bolstered. From this perspective, order transition can occur even absent war. These transitions can occur gradually through incremental evolution or suddenly, as the Soviet Union’s collapse demonstrates, but they need not require great power war or even a great power competitor.6 Prominent Chinese scholars speculating on order transition understand this as fact, with Yuan Peng—the head of the Ministry of State Security’s think tank—arguing that the pandemic may play the same role in order transition as a great power war.

- What are the stakes of a competition over order? The United States often inadequately examines the foundations of its own order. Instead of studying the foundations of hegemony, many Americans take features of the international system as granted rather than as products of American power. For example, the presumption that states should generally be democratic, and that they should not engage in genocide, nuclear proliferation, territorial conquest, biological weapons usage, or nakedly illiberal behavior (versus illiberal behavior at least wrapped notionally in a cloak of legitimacy) is a product of the costs generated for engaging in that behavior by US order, even if Washington’s own adherence to or defense of these norms is imperfect. The deference the United States receives from its allies and partners in many cases is also a product of order, as is the relatively uncontroversial acceptance of American overseas bases or of the dollar as reserve currency. This is a fact illiberal states like China, which have written for decades about the liberal bias of the international system and the foundational aspects of American hegemony, cannot afford to forget. China does not simply bemoan the international system’s presumptions of American structural advantages but interrogates them, asks why they are the way they are, and seeks to reshape the system more to its liking by constructing its own order.

- In the 1990s and 2000s, China did in fact have a marginally more open Internet, more freedom for academics, some tolerance for human rights lawyers, and a willingness to consider some marginal distance between the Party and state. But the moment the Party ascertained that these developments were a threat to its power, it reversed course—a process that began in the mid-2000s and has intensified with every passing year since.

- a truly competitive strategy with China cannot be entirely symmetric. US efforts should often be asymmetric and seek to blunt Chinese order-building at a cost lower than the one China incurs to advance it. ([Location 7439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=7439))

- any competitive strategy should begin with the understanding that US-China competition is predominantly over regional and global order as well as the “forms of control” that underpin it. Accordingly, a competitive strategy will involve not only efforts to blunt Chinese order, but also efforts to rebuild the foundations of US order.

- The United States will be unable to compete with China symmetrically—that is, dollar-for-dollar, ship-for-ship, or loan-for-loan—in part because of China’s sheer relative size. For more than a century, no US adversary or coalition of adversaries reached 60 percent of US GDP. Neither Wilhelmine Germany during the First World War, the combined might of Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany during the Second World War, nor the Soviet Union at the height of its economic power ever crossed this threshold.44 And yet, this is a milestone that China itself quietly reached as early as 2014. China is also on track to surpass the United States in economic size. When one adjusts for the relative price of goods (i.e., purchasing power parity), China’s economy is already 25 percent larger than the US economy.

- American openness and rule of law produce more constant advantages. They offer allies and even adversaries voice opportunities within the order, broadcast American intentions and ambitions, and are often combined with global goods provision—thereby making US hegemony less threatening and more acceptable. Critically, these advantages also ensure that the country can attract the allies, immigrants, and capital that underpin liberal order, technological innovation, military power, and dollar dominance. These are the foundations of American order, and they provide a unique advantage relative to China. Building and rebuilding them must remain a priority.

- competition over order is about blunting an opponent’s “forms of control” and building one’s own forms of control. In competition with China, these strategies—blunting and building—should not be implemented in a symmetric way that puts forward an American initiative to match up against each Chinese economic, military, or political initiative. Instead, the objective would be to compete judiciously, prioritizing certain countries, regions, and sub-structures within the international system.

- forms of control have upstream and downstream components. For example, when the United States wields financial statecraft, that exercise has an “upstream” source (American dollar dominance) from which flows the “downstream” effect (the punished state faces financial stress). China could seek to blunt American financial power by focusing on that “upstream” source by working to make the dollar less dominant or by targeting the “downstream” effect by providing financial support to the sanctioned state. When blunting asymmetrically, it can sometimes be cheaper to target forms of control downstream; when building or safeguarding one’s own forms of control, it may be more valuable to prioritize a competitor’s challenge to the upstream sources of that leverage rather than the varouis challenges to the downstream effects of that leverage.

- A strategy of blunting Chinese order focuses on the main “forms of control” China is constructing at the regional and global level and then seeks to address them asymmetrically. In general, US strategy should be to undermine China’s order-building at the regional level in part by blunting the exercise of Chinese power as well as by empowering states that might otherwise fall within Chinese order so that they retain some agency from Beijing.

- The dollar’s success has brought complications: the United States suffers from a dollar-driven variant of “Dutch Disease,” where reliance on a particular export can cause deindustrialization if institutions cannot properly manage the windfall. In this respect the United States is “the Saudi Arabia of money,” with much of its manufacturing capacity atrophying while its assets skyrocket in price.58 Currency has driven Dutch Disease in other countries in the past—colonial Spain benefited from a windfall of gold from the Americas, for example—but the end of that gold supply brought a disastrous geopolitical fall.

- Although the dollar’s position is strong, two trends now threaten it, and relatedly, US hegemony. The first is the overuse of financial sanctions, which has already driven some allies and adversaries to unite in (so far unsuccessful) efforts to bypass the dollar system. Second, and more important, China is rolling out a digital RMB to compete with the US dollar that completely bypasses US payments infrastructure. Chinese officials have long worried about the potential of a US-led digital currency that would bolster the US dollar system, and so they have raced for first-mover advantage.

- China has demonstrated a willingness to use its nodal position in modern supply chains as leverage against other countries. The United States presently has a poor understanding of these connections. Indeed, the pandemic has revealed that no government agency was aware of how dependent the United States was on China for medicine, and similar dependencies from rare earths to microelectronics persist. To secure itself and position its allies and partners to resist China’s coercive economic diplomacy, the United States should launch a permanent effort institutionalized in a federal government agency and bolstered through mandatory reporting requirements to audit supply chains across most industries. The office would also run stress tests of the US supply chain. ([Location 7724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=7724))

- As a presidential candidate sixty years ago, when Americans were still reeling from the Sputnik shock, John F. Kennedy addressed a municipal auditorium in Canton, Ohio. The country faced serious crises, and Kennedy enumerated them: low wages, high housing costs, a growing risk of conflict, the gradual shrinkage of industry, and the rise of a new rival that appeared to be on the march while the United States stood still. “What we have to overcome,” Kennedy said then, is “that psychological feeling in the world that the United States has reached maturity, that maybe our high noon has passed, maybe our brightest days were earlier, and that now we are going into the long, slow afternoon. . . . I don’t hold that view at all, and neither do the people of this country.”13 ([Location 7909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0971BRJ6V&location=7909))
