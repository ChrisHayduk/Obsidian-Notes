- “All progress depends upon the unreasonable man,” the “creatively maladjusted,” Khosla declared, borrowing eclectically from George Bernard Shaw and Martin Luther King Jr.[4] “Most people think improbable ideas are unimportant,” he loved to add, “but the only thing that’s important is something that’s improbable.” If you were going to pitch Khosla an invention, it had better not fall into the incremental category he called “one sheet of toilet paper, not two.”[5] Khosla wanted radical dreams, the bolder and more improbable the better.

- “You can imagine, if Pat fails, the hubris of saying he could eliminate animal husbandry; he’ll be mocked for that,” Khosla observed. But, he continued, the mockery would be misplaced. Which is better: to try and fail, or to fail to try?[13] ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0942SZJ8H&location=176))

And once you cross that perilous frontier, you better begin to think differently. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0942SZJ8H&location=220))

- Horsley Bridge is an investment company with stakes in venture funds that backed 7,000 startups between 1985 and 2014. A small subset of these deals, accounting for just 5 percent of the total capital deployed, generated fully 60 percent of all the Horsley Bridge returns during this period.[17] ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0942SZJ8H&location=231))

- “The biggest secret in venture capital is that the best investment in a successful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund,” the venture capitalist Peter Thiel has written.[20] “Venture capital is not even a home-run business,” Bill Gurley of Benchmark Capital once remarked. “It’s a grand-slam business.”[21] ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0942SZJ8H&location=238))

- Of course, investing in what is categorically impossible is a waste of resources. But the more common error, the more human one, is to invest too timidly: to back obvious ideas that others can copy and from which, consequently, it will be hard to extract profits.

- Venture capital was not merely a business; it was a mindset, a philosophy, a theory of progress. Seven hundred million people enjoyed the lifestyle that seven billion wanted, he liked to say. Bold innovators goaded by even bolder venture capitalists offered the best shot at satisfying human aspirations.[31] ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0942SZJ8H&location=291))

- the way venture capitalists see things, the disciplined calibrations of conventional social scientists can be a blindfold, not a telescope. Extrapolations from past data anticipate the future only when there is not much to anticipate; if tomorrow will be a mere extension of today, why bother with forecasting? The revolutions that will matter—the big disruptions that create wealth for inventors and anxiety for workers, or that scramble the geopolitical balance and alter human relations—cannot be predicted based on extrapolations of past data, precisely because such revolutions are so thoroughly disruptive.

- Most financiers allocate scarce capital based on quantitative analysis. Venture capitalists meet people, charm people, and seldom bother with spreadsheets.[36] Most financiers value companies by projecting their cash flows. Venture capitalists frequently back startups before they have cash flows to analyze. Other financiers trade millions of dollars of paper assets in the blink of an eye. Venture capitalists take relatively small stakes in real companies and hold them. Most fundamentally, other financiers extrapolate trends from the past, disregarding the risk of extreme “tail” events. Venture capitalists look for radical departures from the past. Tail events are all they care about. ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0942SZJ8H&location=349))

- It is the contention of this book that this frenzy of activity explains much of the variation in creativity across regions: by forging connections among entrepreneurs, ideas, customers, and capital, venture capitalists transform a mere agglomeration of smart people into an inventive network.

- In an earlier era, J. P. Morgan’s brand of finance fashioned American business into muscular oligopolies; in the 1980s, Michael Milken’s junk bonds fueled a burst of corporate takeovers and slash-and-burn cost cuts. In similar fashion, venture capital has stamped its mark on an industrial culture, making Silicon Valley the most durably productive crucible of applied science anywhere, ever.

- The 1929 crash and the ensuing Depression had destroyed investors’ risk appetite for a generation; the big money-management houses had names like Fidelity and Prudential and were more interested in preserving capital than in taking chances.

- In lectures delivered in his thick French accent, he proclaimed that the greatest rewards were to be had from the most ambitious and least obvious projects; that investors would have to wait patiently for returns to mature over the long term; and that the best prospects involved advanced technology, not orange juice or fishing in Asia.[56] Anticipating later venture capitalists, he understood that his role was to provide not simply money but also managerial counsel, assistance with hiring, and tips on everything from marketing to finance. He staged technology fairs to advertise his portfolio companies’ products and advised Digital Equipment to present sample circuit boards on sheets of purple velvet, in the manner of a jeweler showing off a brooch. Plugging his protégés into ARD’s network was all part of Doriot’s service. “Your company was on display,” one founder said of ARD’s well-attended annual meetings, at which entrepreneurs mingled with investors. “The networking that was created and the introductions that were possible, all of that was very important. Anything that helps you keep your confidence, when you have no reason to have confidence, is valuable.”[57] ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0942SZJ8H&location=642))

- Rock and his partner articulated an approach to risk management that would resonate with future venture capitalists. Modern portfolio theory, the set of ideas that was coming to dominate academic finance, stressed diversification: by owning a broad mix of assets exposed to a wide variety of uncorrelated risks, investors could reduce the overall volatility of their holdings and improve their risk-return ratio. Davis and Rock ignored this teaching: they promised to make concentrated bets on a dozen or so companies. ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0942SZJ8H&location=992))

- by buying just under half of a firm’s equity, the Davis & Rock partnership would get a seat on the board and a say in its strategy: in the absence of diversification, a venture capitalist could manage his risk by exercising a measure of control over his assets.

- Self-contradiction, wishful thinking, a fondness for ingratiation at the expense of honesty: these were the clues that Rock should pass on an investment. Intelligent consistency, gritty realism, fiery determination: these were the signs that he should seize the opportunity.[33] ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0942SZJ8H&location=1030))

- What struck Rock particularly was Palevsky’s warmth and informality.[40] He could joke, flatter and cajole, and generally draw the best out of others: he was an anti-Shockley. Entrepreneurs with managerial magic can’t lose, Rock reflected later. “If their strategy doesn’t work, they can develop another one.”[41] ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0942SZJ8H&location=1063))

- Fortuitously, the 1970s marked the arrival of a new kind of venture investor, equipped with an expanded tool kit that transformed previously unbackable Atari-type startups into thinkable wagers. Rather than merely identifying entrepreneurs and monitoring them, as Rock had done, the new venture capitalists actively shaped them: they told company founders whom to hire, how to sell, and how to structure their research. And to ensure that their instructions were implemented, the new venture capitalists came up with a second innovation: rather than organizing one large fundraising, they doled out capital in tranches, with each cautious infusion calibrated to support the company until it reached an agreed milestone.

- A cluster that is dominated by large, self-contained, secretive companies will be characterized by tight relationships among insiders at each firm, but few links between professionals at one firm and similar professionals at another one. In contrast, a cluster that consists of transient startups will feature fewer deep bonds among colleagues, but it will be enriched by myriad, looser external connections. Saxenian’s contention was that a small number of tight relationships makes for less idea sharing and innovation than a large number of loose relationships.

- Bill Younger, who joined Sutter Hill in 1981, set himself the task of taking the smartest people in his Rolodex to lunch; at the end of every meal he’d ask, “Who is the absolutely best guy you’ve worked with?” Younger then made it his mission to meet that best guy—it was almost never a woman—and toward the end of the meeting he would repeat the question: “Who is the absolutely best guy out there?”[10] After a year of moving from one best guy to the next one, Younger had a list of about eighty superstars, and he cultivated each of them methodically. He would send one luminary a technical article that might be relevant to his research; he would call another to mention that an old colleague was asking after him. In this way, Younger spun a web of loose connections that would form the basis for productive startups when the right opportunities beckoned. The social capital that Saxenian stressed did not arise by accident.[11] ([Location 2000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0942SZJ8H&location=2000))

- A fleet of switching and routing companies sailed around Cisco, and Valentine stood on the deck of the flagship, remaining its chairman long after an IPO had multiplied Sequoia’s investment nearly forty times over. From this privileged vantage point, Valentine could see which sorts of innovative networking technology Cisco might want to acquire. As a result, Sequoia backed a series of startups that it sold profitably to the mother ship. The partnership’s reputation swelled, and Silicon Valley flourished.

What’s more, competition was bound to be especially ferocious because of the winner-takes-all logic of Yahoo’s business. Internet users were likely to gravitate to a single way of searching for information on the web. The winner would capture the lion’s share of online ad dollars. The also-rans would collect pennies.

- As often happens in finance, the player who first sees a shift in the landscape, and who has the ready capital to match the novel need, can make bumper profits before competitors wake up.

Given the flush state of the venture funds, it was a good time to test their limits. Capital, being plentiful, would logically be cheap. A pair of unusually confident founders had an opportunity to show how far the capitalists could be forced into concessions.

- In 2010, Andreessen Horowitz invested $250,000 in the social-networking app Instagram. It was by some metrics a spectacular home run: two years later, Facebook paid $1 billion for Instagram, and Andreessen netted $78 million—a 312x return on its investment. And yet by other measures this was a debacle. Andreessen Horowitz made the Instagram investment out of a $1.5 billion fund, so it needed fully nineteen $78 million payouts merely to break even. To have backed a winning company was nice for the ego. But the brutal truth was that Instagram had been a wasted opportunity.

An industry that had initially consisted of generalist investors, and that later featured Accel-style specialists, was now dividing into seed investors, early-stage investors, and growth investors. Meanwhile, the capitalists were learning to defer to the founders; VC became less about Valentine-Perkins hands-on investing and more about Rock-style liberation.

In the end, venture investing came down to that scary jump from messy information to a binary yes-or-no call.

Second, the good news about consumer internet companies was that you could judge their prospects in a different way: you could look past the founders and analyze the data on their progress. The next time Accel came across an internet property that customers turned to multiple times per day, it should seal the deal no matter what.

- Compton even argued that the cleantech error violated the lessons handed down by Tom Perkins himself. Far from going all in on high-stakes bets, Perkins had used small amounts of capital to eliminate the main risks in a venture—the “white-hot risks,” as he called them. Moreover, far from swooning over new technologies, Perkins often cautioned that for an innovation to matter, it had to be radically better than what came before. “If it’s not 10x different, it’s not different,” went his mantra.[48] ([Location 5243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0942SZJ8H&location=5243))

- Shleifer began by applying a technique that was standard at Blackstone but foreign to most Valley investors. Rather than looking at profit margins—that is, the share of revenues remaining after costs are deducted—he looked at incremental margins, meaning the share of revenue growth that falls to the bottom line as profits. Any amateur could see that the three Chinese portals all had negative margins; put simply, they were losing money. But a pro would know to focus on the incremental picture, and this looked spectacularly positive. As revenues grew, costs grew much less, so most of the additional income showed up as profits. It followed that growth would soon drive the three portals into the black. By thinking incrementally, Shleifer could see into the future.
