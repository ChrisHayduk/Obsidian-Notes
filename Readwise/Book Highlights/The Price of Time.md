- Bastiat was having none of this. Interest wasn’t theft, he maintained, but a fair reward for a mutual exchange of services. The lender provides the use of capital for a period of time, and time has value. Bastiat cites the famous lines from Benjamin Franklin’s Advice to a Young Tradesman (1748): ‘Time is precious. Time is money – Time is the stuff of which life is made.’ ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=408))

- Bastiat foresaw disaster if Proudhon’s plans were put into practice. If lending were not rewarded, there would be no lending. To restrict payments on capital would be to abolish capital.11 ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=415))

- In the sphere of economics, a habit, an institution, or a law engenders not just one effect but a series of effects. Of these effects only the first is immediate; it is revealed simultaneously with its cause; it is seen. The others merely occur successively; they are not seen; we are lucky if we foresee them. The entire difference between a bad and a good Economist is apparent here. A bad one relies on the visible effect, while the good one takes account of both the effect one can see and of those one must foresee.16 The bad economist, says Bastiat, pursues a small current benefit that is followed by a large disadvantage in the future, while the good economist pursues a large benefit in the future at the risk of suffering a small disadvantage in the near term.

- He attacked what he called the ‘fetish’ of full employment. Schumpeter’s idea of ‘creative destruction’ must be allowed to operate unhindered, Hazlitt wrote, as it was as important for the health of an economy that dying industries be allowed to die as it was for growing industries to be allowed to grow.19 Hazlitt compared the price system in a competitive economy to the automatic regulator on a steam engine. Any attempt to prevent prices from falling would only keep inefficient producers in business. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=460))

- After the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in September 2008, neoliberal economists implemented the anarchist Proudhon’s revolutionary scheme. Central bankers pushed interest rates to their lowest level in five millennia. In Europe and Japan, rates turned negative – an unprecedented development. The results were not as Proudhon anticipated, however. Rather, Bastiat’s grim forebodings about free credit appear closer to the truth.

- White suggested that the sharp decline in interest rates had encouraged households to spend more and save less. The downside of bringing forward consumption from the future, White suggested, was that people must in fact save more for any predetermined goal; ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=483))

- The authorities believed that low rates would boost corporate investment. But White suggested firms were actually investing less. Furthermore, ultra-easy money was responsible for the misallocation of capital. Creative destruction was thwarted.

- This book is about the role of interest in a modern economy. It was inspired by a Bastiat-like conviction that ultra-low interest rates were contributing to many of our current woes, whether the collapse of productivity growth, unaffordable housing, rising inequality, the loss of market competition or financial fragility. Ultra-low rates also seemed to play some role in the resurgence of populism as Sumner’s Forgotten Man started to lose patience.

- The most encompassing view of interest is contained in the notion of interest as the ‘time value of money’ or, simply, as the price of time. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=540))

- if the rate of interest is linked to profitability, as most economists have believed since the time of Adam Smith, then interest rates and the pace of economic growth (i.e. the rate of return for the whole economy) must also be connected.

- The most important question addressed in this book is whether a capitalist economy can function properly without market-determined interest. ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=567))

- The argument of this book is that interest is required to direct the allocation of capital, and that without interest it becomes impossible to value investments. As a ‘reward for abstinence’ interest incentivizes saving. Interest is also the cost of leverage and the price of risk. When it comes to regulating financial markets, the existence of interest discourages bankers and investors from taking excessive risks. On the foreign exchanges, interest rates equilibrate the flow of capital between nations. Interest also influences the distribution of income and wealth. As Bastiat understood, a very low rate of interest may benefit the rich, who have access to credit, more than the poor.

- Temples were the main providers of loans in the Ancient Near East initially. Palaces also supplied credit. These institutional creditors used the interest on loans to redistribute resources, handing out food rations to widows and orphans and others.

- Keynes, who studied Babylonian monetary history while researching his Treatise on Money, believed that interest rates were determined by custom rather than market forces. As his disciple Joan Robinson put it, interest has a ‘Cheshire cat grin [which] … remains after the circumstances which gave rise to it in the past have completely vanished’.41 ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=773))

- Recent research from the Bank for International Settlements suggests that interest rates over the past hundred years or so have been more influenced by the nature of the various monetary regimes (Gold Standard, Gold Exchange Standard, Bretton Woods and Dollar Standard) than by economic factors such as individual savings and investment decisions.

- In short, the ancient history of interest provides no strong support for any particular view as to how the rate of interest is formed. Law and custom obviously played an important role. Yet occasional changes in the quantity of money in circulation also appear to have influenced interest rates. Market forces were at play, to some extent at least.

- Böhm-Bawerk declared that the cultural level of a nation is mirrored by its rate of interest. In the ancient world, interest rates charted the course of great civilizations. In Babylon, Greece and Rome interest rates followed a U-shaped curve over the centuries; declining as each civilization became established and prospered, and rising sharply during periods of decline and fall.57 Very low interest rates appear to have been the calm before the storm.

- In any society with private property, whether in Mesopotamia or later civilizations, the payment of interest is required to induce people to lend their resources. Without interest, they would inevitably have hoarded their capital. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=865))

- In ancient Babylon, a person with spare funds had a choice between buying and cultivating some land or lending the money to a third party who could use the loan to acquire a farm. It seems obvious that the rate of interest and the productivity of capital, in this case the farm surplus, should bear some relation to each other.

- Turgot elaborated on Barbon’s insight: ‘Every capital in the form of money … is the equivalent of a piece of land producing a revenue equal to a particular fraction of this sum.’64 For Turgot, the world of finance was a mirror held up to the world, with real and financial assets exchangeable for each other. Since land, buildings and factories produce income, so money must yield interest. This important insight is too often overlooked by modern economists.

- These new financial practices added to the effective money supply and contributed to the decline in medieval interest rates. Loans in northern Italy were to be had for around 20 per cent in 1200. By Datini’s day, the rates on commercial loans in Genoa had fallen to 7 per cent. ([Location 1040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1040))

- Once the idea took hold that time not only had value but was an individual’s possession, clerical injunctions against usury lost much of their force. If a merchant gained from a loan, why shouldn’t the lender share in those profits? In fact, the idea that the lender should be protected against lost profits is embedded in the very concept of interest.

- From a technical viewpoint, capital consists of a stream of future income discounted to its present value. Without interest, there can be no capital. Without capital, no capitalism. ([Location 1155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1155))

- Younger people may borrow and spend, paying back their loans later in life – what economists call ‘income-smoothing’. The interest rate they pay reflects their time preference. Older people are likely to have a lower time preference and be less inclined to borrow at interest, partly because their incomes are no longer growing. Countries with ageing populations tend to have falling interest rates. ([Location 1186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1186))

- Interest – the time value of money – lies at the heart of valuation. At the turn of the eighteenth century, the brilliant Scotsman John Law (whom we encounter in Chapter 4) wrote that ‘anticipation is always at a discount. £100 to be paid now is of more value than £1,000 to be paid £10 a year for 100 years.’67 By discounting the future cash flow generated by a stock, bond, building or any other income-producing asset, interest allows us to arrive at its present value.

- For Hayek, it was axiomatic, but all too often overlooked, that ‘all economic activity is carried out through time.’71 When interest rates decline, he said, businesses are inclined to invest in projects with more distant pay-offs – in Hayek’s terminology, the ‘structure of production’ lengthens. If interest rates are kept below their natural level, misguided investments occur: too much time is used in production, or, put another way, the investment returns don’t justify the initial outlay.

- The decline in European interest rates in the late Middle Ages facilitated the accumulation of capital, which in turn produced a further lowering of rates.

- Child put the cart before the horse when he claimed that low interest rates were the cause of Dutch wealth. The lowness of interest in Holland, said Locke, was not ‘an effect of Law … but as the Consequence of great Plenty of ready Money’, just as the Scots were not poor because they paid high interest, but rather paid high interest because they were poor.

- The notion that interest must be free to find its own level underpins Locke’s argument. Any attempt to regulate interest, he believed, would only ‘increase the arts of lending’ as borrowers and lenders would seek to evade the law.

- in 1802, England was at war with France and the Bank of England had suspended convertibility of its notes into gold. An economic boom was under way, but the usury laws prevented the Bank from charging more than 5 per cent – an ‘unnatural and extraordinarily low’ level, in Thornton’s view. Borrowers were able to obtain loans cheaply: ‘That which they obtain too cheap they demand in too great quantity,’ lamented the prudent banker. In so many words, Thornton was suggesting that providing paper credit at below the natural rate of interest created the conditions for an unstable financial boom. The severe crisis that broke out in the City of London in the summer of 1810 appeared to vindicate Thornton’s view.

- the natural rate of interest is unobservable, a pure abstraction – in Wicksell’s description it is the rate at which capital would be lent in a world of barter, lacking any type of money. ([Location 1466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1466))

- Like Locke, we may be fuzzy about where the natural rate of interest lies exactly, but we can tell its absence. When the cost of borrowing is set at too high a level, then businesses won’t borrow to invest, creditors gain unduly at the expense of debtors, capital values are depressed, workers remain idle and the economy stagnates. When bond yields far exceed the growth in national income, then existing debt becomes burdensome and bankruptcy beckons. (Economists refer to this state of affairs as a ‘debt trap’.) High interest is associated with deflation and what Bacon called ‘public poverty’. As we shall see, Britain suffered many of these ills after its ill-fated return to the Gold Standard in the 1920s caused interest rates to rise to unbearable levels.

- An excessively low rate of interest may be signalled by a rise in inflation. But it’s not just a question of changes in the level of consumer prices. When asset price bubbles proliferate, credit booms, finance crowds out honest endeavour, savings collapse and capital is misallocated on a grand scale, the chances are that market rates of interest are not aligned with the natural rate. ([Location 1482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1482))
- In short, Locke argued that a forced reduction in interest rates imparts no benefit to a society lacking in ‘industry and frugality’. ([Location 1492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1492))

- this outbreak of speculative fever wasn’t a random event. In this chapter, we trace the source of the Mississippi bubble and its subsequent collapse to Law’s ambitious monetary experiment and, in particular, his policy of expanding France’s money supply and cutting interest rates. While Locke considered the inconveniences that might take the rate of interest below its natural level, Law conducted the world’s first experiment with easy money. His story of boom and bust is a cautionary tale for our times. ([Location 1553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1553))

- Money, he said, did not derive its value from precious metals, as people like Locke believed. Rather, money was simply a yardstick of value; or, as he put it, ‘Money is not the Value for which Goods are exchanged, but the Value by which they are exchanged.’5 This clever switching of the prepositions – by in place of for – amounted to a monetary revolution. In essence, he was saying that since money lacked intrinsic value it need not be backed by gold or other precious metals.

- Law anticipates later monetarists. He argued that prosperity could be achieved by establishing a bank that issued paper money, collateralized with land rather than gold and silver. By severing the link between money and precious metals, Law opened the possibility of a managed currency. ([Location 1566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1566))

- In his early pamphlets, Law argued that interest was determined by the supply of money and that a national bank could bring about a reduction in interest by increasing the money supply. He believed that the Dutch enjoyed lower borrowing costs because they had a greater quantity of money in circulation (not, as Locke and others supposed, because the Dutch were thrifty and possessed a greater stock of capital).

- Like Josiah Child before him, Law anticipated that great economic benefits would follow from a reduction in the cost of borrowing: ‘If lowness of interest were the consequence of a greater quantity of money, the stock applied to trade would be greater, and merchants would trade cheaper, from the easiness of borrowing, and the lower interest of money, without any inconveniences attending it,’ ([Location 1608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1608))

- In modern language, Law was suggesting that a central bank could reduce interest rates by printing money; that this would alleviate the position of heavily indebted borrowers (in this case, French nobles), create jobs and revive the economy. At the same time, the cost of servicing government debt would fall and deflation come to an end. ([Location 1616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1616))

- The main stimulus for the bubble came from the Royal Bank’s printing press. Over the course of 1719, the amount of paper money in circulation increased by an estimated billion livres.23 The bank employed eight printers around the clock to crank out notes in large denominations. The most commonly issued note was worth 10,000 livres. ([Location 1680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1680))

- In his earlier writings, Law had expressed the view that East India Company shares were like money since they could be used for the settlement of debt. Under his System, bank money and Mississippi stock became interchangeable. Loans to speculators, supplied against share collateral, were provided by the Royal Bank at 2 per cent.

- At the market peak in late 1719, the yield on government debt stood at 2 per cent and loans for share purchases (margin loans) cost the same amount, while Mississippi shares traded at close to fifty times earnings and paid a dividend equal to 2 per cent of the market price (admittedly, the dividend was not quite covered by earnings). Law himself was aware that the valuation of the Company’s shares depended on the rate of interest. In early 1720, he even justified the high share price by reference to the low prevailing interest.30 Writing on the Mississippi Bubble some half a century later, the Scottish economist Sir James Steuart shrewdly commented that ‘value, in capital, really existed relatively to the rate of interest.’31 ([Location 1708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1708))

- In the short-term, Cantillon averred, a national bank could drive down interest rates by purchasing government debt with newly printed money. Expectations of further declines in interest rates would induce the public to acquire bonds, further lowering market rates and raising the price of securities. Such banking operations were fraught with risk, however. The economy would prosper only as long as the extra money balances, created by the note issues, remained trapped within the financial system: ‘The excess banknotes, made and issued on these occasions, do not upset the circulation [i.e. produce inflation], because being used for the buying and selling of stock [i.e. financial assets] they do not serve for household expenses and are not changed into silver.’50 But once the money escaped into the wider economy, consumer prices were bound to rise. Besides, said Cantillon, it was all very well for the bank to buy stocks in a rising market. But to whom would it sell them in a falling one? ‘If the Bank alone raises the price of public stock by buying it, it will by so much depress it when it resells to cancel its excess issue of notes.’ ([Location 1812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1812))

- The collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 produced economic and financial conditions – a toxic mixture of deflation, high unemployment and soaring government debt – somewhat similar to France’s after the death of Louis XIV. Monetary policymakers responded to these conditions by taking a leaf from Law’s copybook, pushing down interest rates and acquiring large chunks of their national debt (although not going quite so far as Law) with newly printed money. There’s another similarity. After 2008, the Federal Reserve embarked on a deliberate policy of boosting asset prices by reducing the discount rate. While Law created Mississippi millionaires, his twenty-first-century imitators minted billionaires by the score. In the decade after the global financial crisis, central bankers justified their unconventional monetary policies on the grounds that consumer price inflation was quiescent. But, as Cantillon pointed out, when a national bank turns on the printing press and buys up government debt, the newly created money is initially trapped within the financial system, where it inflates financial assets rather than consumer prices, and only slowly seeps out into the wider economy.fn11 As we describe in later chapters, Defoe’s description of Law’s System as ‘an inconceivable species of mere air and shadow’ might equally well apply to the central-bank engineered economic recovery after 2008.

- While Overstone elaborated the phases of the credit cycle, Bagehot looked into its causes. The cycle arose, he said, from ‘the different amounts of loanable capital which are available at different times for the supply of trade’.5 Any number of reasons might cause the amount of loanable capital to vary – a gold discovery, the excessive issue of banknotes or the expansion of trade. But there was also a psychological element. ‘Credit, the disposition of one man to trust another, is singularly varying,’ Bagehot wrote.6 Interest is the barometer of trust, rising and falling over the course of the cycle. Too much trust is a dangerous thing. ([Location 1919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1919))

- Bagehot observed that outbreaks of financial recklessness did not occur at random. Rather, they tended to appear at times when money was easy and interest rates low. He expressed this insight in his own inimitable fashion: ‘John Bull can stand many things, but he cannot stand two per cent.’14 When interest rates fell to such a low level, investors reacted to the loss of income by taking greater risks. In modern language, they engage in ‘yield-chasing’. ([Location 1990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=1990))

- Bagehot intuitively understood how people were habituated to a certain return on their investments and how, when the accustomed income was not available, investors were inclined to take more risk: ‘The fact is, that the owners of savings not finding, in adequate quantities, their usual kind of investments, rush into anything that promises speciously.’19 ([Location 2010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=2010))

They do not lend at high interest but at the lowest rates. Their emergency loans are not provided for a short period, but for years on end. They do not lend against high-quality collateral but reach to the outer edges of the credit spectrum. Modern central bankers show far less concern for moral hazard than Bagehot – and their actions would give Thomson Hankey an acute case of neuralgia.

- The outbreak of war in 1914 led most central banks to suspend gold payments (the United States was an exception). In 1922, finance ministers from several dozen nations met in Genoa to discuss how to reconstruct the international monetary order. They decided against resurrecting the Gold Standard that had prevailed before the war, proposing in its place a modified version.7 The main idea behind the Gold Exchange Standard, as it was called, was to economize on gold: under this new regime government securities held by a central bank were counted as reserves, alongside gold.

- Most financial histories of the 1920s and its aftermath fail to mention contemporary criticisms of the Federal Reserve’s price stabilization policy and pass over the coup de whisky delivered to the US stock market after the Long Island meeting. According to this orthodox narrative, there was nothing untoward about the US economy in the 1920s and there was no bubble in property or stocks. Everything was progressing just fine until Ben Strong sickened and retired from the New York Fed in late 1927. Thereafter, Strong’s former colleagues, taking fright at the speculative orgy on Wall Street, unduly tightened monetary policy, thereby inducing a sharp economic downturn. ‘The true story [of the Great Depression],’ maintained the future Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, ‘is that monetary policy tried overzealously to stop the rise in stock prices.’fn14 ([Location 2662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=2662))

- Hayek argued that the new technologies and efficiency improvements of the 1920s brought about a ‘good’ deflation, the type of deflation that Marshall was referring to in his comments to the Royal Commission. When policymakers ease monetary conditions to ward off such a benign decline in the price level, people are incentivized to borrow more. As Irving Fisher observed, debt deflation starts from a position of over-indebtedness – a point which Bernanke in his writings on the subject conspicuously overlooks. Thus, Hayek concluded that attempts to avoid a good deflation only make ‘bad’ deflation more likely. Furthermore, the bad deflation that appears during a financial crisis should be viewed as a symptom, rather than a cause of economic malaise. Debt deflation, Hayek concluded, is ‘a secondary phenomenon, a process induced by the maladjustments of industry left over from the boom’.74 ([Location 2709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=2709))

If accuracy of prediction is what matters for economic theory, as Milton Friedman later claimed, then Hayek’s interpretation should have become the received wisdom of his profession. Yet the Austrian’s interpretation of the 1920s and its aftermath has been more or less air-brushed from the history books, while Fisher’s monetarist view has become received wisdom.

Past financial crises, White noted, had often appeared without any prior pick-up of inflation – the recent Asian crisis being a case in point.

- White also questioned the policy, championed by Bernanke, of dealing with the aftermath of a bubble rather than forestalling it. An over-indebted economy might enter a liquidity trap, rendering it impervious to monetary stimulus. If capital was misallocated during the boom, then low interest rates after the bust might contribute to economic sclerosis, as Japan had experienced over the previous decade. Reducing interest rates after a bubble’s collapse might discourage saving, thereby reducing the economy’s growth prospects: ‘If low rates are maintained for an extended period,’ White suggested, ‘they may or may not have the desired effect on aggregate demand, but they clearly have negative long-term effects with respect to aggregate supply.’ Finally, he predicted that low rates would drive a search for yield from insurance companies and defined benefit pension plans.

- Bernanke’s analysis ignores the fact that the riskiest subprime loans were priced off short-term rates, including the option of adjustable-rate mortgages with their negative amortization feature (in which interest was rolled up with the principal). It was only after the Fed’s easy money policy was launched that credit growth picked up, financial leverage soared, housing markets bubbled, underwriting standards declined and the repackaging of subprime mortgage debt into collateralized debt obligations took off. Low interest rates fed the demand for credit, while financial innovation increased its supply. The explosive growth of the market for complex mortgage securities was driven in large part by a desperate search for yield at a time when interest rates were at multi-decade lows.

Yet despite these safeguards, Spain suffered a worse financial shock than the United States and the near total collapse of its local savings banks (cajas).

- Why were the credit systems of so many different countries, from Australia to Iceland, so vulnerable at the time? The unifying factor appears to be the low-interest rate policy of the Federal Reserve at the turn of the century, which, owing to the special position of the dollar as the global reserve currency, created the conditions for a credit boom that engulfed much of the world’s economy. Prior to the crisis, global interest rates were negative in real terms and far below the growth rate of the world’s economy. Even countries with relatively high interest rates enjoyed no respite, since they were inundated with foreign capital flows.fn9 There’s no need to appeal to ad hoc explanations: easy money produced the boom and the boom was followed by the inevitable bust.

Besides, in a growing economy there is a tendency for prices to move up and down a little, not sideways. As to the idea that monetary policy should be eased at a time when the economy was robust and unemployment low merely because inflation trailed the target, well, Volcker thought, ‘certainly, that would be nonsense.’45 ([Location 3091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3091))

- The idea that errors in monetary policy might produce economic distortions, other than disturbances to the price level, was not countenanced by the central banking establishment. But Borio’s research led inexorably to this conclusion. Financial imbalances – a polite term for credit booms and speculative manias – tend to form during periods of low interest rates and low inflation, he noted.fn5 Before the financial crisis, global interest rates were low both in real terms and relative to the growth rate of the global economy. Credit booms and real estate bubbles often produce nasty economic shocks and are followed by weak recoveries. The post-Lehman economy conformed to earlier precedents, notably Japan’s after 1990. Central bankers responded to economic stagnation after 2008 by pushing rates even lower. Thus, low rates begat low rates.

- Debt was the missing link in the secular stagnation narrative, said Borio. The path to ever lower rates traversed a mountain of debt. The BIS defined interest as the ‘price of leverage’. It was only to be expected that as the price of leverage – borrowing – declines the stock of debt should increase. The residue of debt left behind by the crisis produced what Borio called a ‘financial drag’. As overburdened households turned to repairing their balance sheets, they borrowed and spent less. Borio and his colleagues found that the share of society’s income used for servicing debt (the debt–service ratio) tends to remain constant over time. Thus, ever lower interest rates are needed to sustain a rising stock of debt. A vicious cycle begins, with more debt requiring lower rates, and lower rates resulting in yet more debt. Some commentators referred to this decades-long process as the ‘debt supercycle’. ([Location 3375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3375))
- ultra-low interest rates eroded the banks’ ‘net interest margin’, damaging their profitability and making them reluctant to initiate new loans.15 And while extreme monetary policies appeared to make banks risk averse, they had the opposite effect on investors.

As Gita Gopinath, a Harvard scholar and future International Monetary Fund chief economist, noted, the shift towards construction depressed productivity: ‘By lowering interest rates and encouraging an inflow of capital, the adoption of the euro may have been partly responsible for the misallocation of capital and the low productivity observed in the South [of Europe].’ ([Location 3562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=3562))

During his two decades at the helm, he returned the firm’s culture to its origins in the 1890s, when corporations operated ‘at the absolute service and mercy of the votaries of frenzied finance’. General Electric became a model of financialization. Welch streamlined its business, disposing of subsidiaries that lacked dominant market positions and buying up firms that competed with retained operations. Tens of thousands of employees were laid off, earning Welch the sobriquet ‘Neutron Jack’ (since the buildings were left standing after the workers had been terminated). He built up a financial services division, GE Capital, that in time accounted for more than half the conglomerate’s profits. Divisional heads were instructed to run their businesses to maximize the share price and were handsomely rewarded for doing so. During Welch’s tenure, GE reported more than a hundred consecutive quarters of earnings growth – an impossible feat achieved through the use of ‘cookie-jar’ accounting. While earnings increased eightfold under Welch’s watch, the stock price soared more than forty times. ([Location 4144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=4144))

The value of houses will rise or fall as the rate of interest falls or rises.’ Not long after Fisher, another American economist, John Burr Williams, described how the act of discounting was key to valuation. ‘Investment Value,’ Williams wrote in The Theory of Investment Value (1938), is ‘defined as the present worth of future dividends, or of future coupons and principal’.2 Since then students of economics and business have been taught how to discount future cash flows and to calculate present values.

- This viewpoint was expressed by Professor John C. Edmunds of Babson College, Boston, in an article for Foreign Policy in the summer of 1996. Edmunds extolled the potential of what he called a ‘New World Wealth Machine’: Many societies, and indeed the entire world, have learned how to create wealth directly. The new approach requires that a state find ways to increase the market value of its stock of productive assets … An economic policy that aims to achieve growth by wealth creation therefore does not attempt to increase the production of goods and services, except as a secondary objective.33 The simplest and most effective way to inflate the value of productive (and not so productive) assets was by lowering the rate of interest. This was the path chosen by the Federal Reserve after 2008. The rationale for ultra-low rates was expressed by Chairman Bernanke in a November 2010 op-ed for the Washington Post: ‘Lower corporate bond rates will encourage investment. And higher stock prices will boost consumer wealth and help increase confidence, which can also spur spending. Increased spending will lead to higher incomes and profits that, in a virtuous circle, will further support economic expansion.’ ([Location 4376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=4376))

- This delicate balance is upset when the market rate of interest falls below society’s ‘crystallized impatience’. When the interest rate is higher than an individual’s time preference, he or she will save more for the future. Conversely, when the market rate is below the public’s time preference people borrow to consume. An abnormally low rate of interest boosts current spending, but the benefits don’t last.

- the policy of ultra-low interest rates, which started with the Dotcom bust and was revived after the subprime crisis, reduced the level of saving in the United States and elsewhere. The collapse in interest rates also lowered the return on retirement investments and raised the value of retirement liabilities. As a result, a pensions crisis appeared in the United States and Europe. Retirees around the world faced the grim prospect of outliving their savings and dying in penury.

- The historian R. H. Tawney described the changing attitudes to usury in sixteenth-century England: The theory of usury had been designed for an age in which the lender was rich and the borrower poor. Now the borrower was often a merchant who raised a loan in order to speculate on the exchanges or to corner the wool crop, and the lender an economic innocent, who sought a secure investment for his savings.5 ([Location 4821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=4821))

Interest under capitalism, he said, should be viewed as a division of the economic surplus between lenders (whom he called ‘money capitalists’) and borrowers (‘industrial capitalists’). A decline in interest rates didn’t necessarily benefit workers, Marx wrote, since ‘interest is a relationship between two capitalists, not between capitalist and labourer.’6 ([Location 4827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=4827))

Unconventional monetary policies arrested Wall Street’s collapse. Bondholders were bailed out. Financial insiders with access to the Fed’s emergency lending facilities got to buy up distressed securities at bargain prices with subsidized loans. Despite record losses on Wall Street, billions of dollars in bonuses were distributed.

- Nowhere in the academic literature was the impact of ultra-low interest rates given due consideration. It was left to a Rothschild banker to provide the missing link. In a letter to the Financial Times in early 2018, Yves-André Istel pointed out that since the early 1980s interest rates had declined from 15 per cent to less than 2 per cent: By itself, the mechanical effect of reducing accordingly the discount rate applied to estimated future cash flows explains largely the rise in value of equities (thus stock options and chief executive compensation), and real estate values. Bond prices rose equally, yields declined. Search for returns became desperate, and massive liquidity encouraged easy low-cost borrowing and leverage. All this benefited, obviously, those holding these assets, with a corresponding effect on inequality in the west.112 ([Location 5155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=5155))

- Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century became an overnight publishing sensation when it appeared in English translation in the spring of 2014 – more bought than read, but much discussed.125 Piketty rejected conventional explanations for inequality based on education and technology.126 Instead, he proposed a fundamental law: inequality rises whenever the return on capital (comprising profits, interest, dividends and rents) exceeds the growth rate of an economy. Piketty expressed this insight with the notation r > g, with r representing the return on capital and g the rate of economic growth. This formula, simple for even non-economists to grasp, became the slogan of the new class war, printed on T-shirts and paraded on banners at Occupy Wall Street demonstrations.

- Galiani saw that probability calculus, which in his day was already applied to commercial insurance, might also be used in the lending business. Interest, he wrote, ‘bears the same ratio to the capital as the probability of loss bears to the probability of repayment’. Since each loan carries a different risk, interest is as varied as are the almost infinite degrees of probability of loss, which is very great in some cases (as in maritime usury), sometimes falls to zero (as in the banks and companies of republics), and sometimes even below zero, becoming a negative quantity (as happened in France in the time of Law’s System).fn1 Viewed from this perspective, interest, said Galiani, can be seen as the ‘price of insurance’.5 ([Location 5269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=5269))

- Modern finance theory states that this shouldn’t be the case. But investors ‘have a deeply ingrained notion that saving is the preservation of wealth and wealth should grow at a “decent” rate’. They won’t accept a loss of income. What’s more, their propensity to assume risk moves inversely with the interest rate. Bagehot was mistaken in one small detail. According to Ma and Zijlstra, risk-taking becomes extreme when bond yields fall below 3 per cent – not the 2 per cent level that drove John Bull to fabled acts of impetuosity.6 ([Location 5297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=5297))

- When short-term rates are low, investors have an incentive to take out loans to buy assets that yield more income. The difference between the cost of borrowing and the return on risky loans is known as the ‘carry’. There are numerous types of carry trades, from hedge funds using leverage to buy mortgage-backed securities to landlords taking out mortgages on their rental properties. The returns from carry trades are asymmetric: investors generally enjoy a steady stream of small gains but are exposed to sudden large losses. In market parlance, carry traders are said to pick up nickels in front of steamrollers. (More crudely, they are said to ‘eat like a bird, shit like an elephant’.)

- ‘[A] prolonged period of low interest rates, of the sort we are experiencing today,’ said Stein, ‘can create incentives for agents to take on greater duration or credit risks, or to employ additional financial leverage, in an effort to “reach for yield”.’ Low rates, he added, had spurred the development of new financial products to satisfy the demand for investment income.fn8 Regulation was all very well, said Stein, but only monetary policy ‘gets into all the cracks’. Stein later pointed out that the Fed’s policy of hiking interest rates by small increments, or ‘baby steps’, so as not to frighten the markets, backfired. The central bank’s predictability encouraged financial players to take on more leverage. The more the Fed fretted about Wall Street, the more cautious it became, and the lower interest rates fell.

That was the view of PIMCO’s ‘Bond King’ Bill Gross, who, displaying his own science credentials, suggested that just as Newtonian physics breaks down at the speed of light, so a market economy ceases to function normally when interest rates approach the zero lower bound.4 Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff stuck with this theme: Just as the normal laws of physics seem to be upended when an object approaches a black hole (or, to be more precise, the normal laws imply weird consequences), the laws of economics seem to be upended when a recession-stricken economy hits (or at least approaches) the zero bound.

    - Note: The spread between 0% interest savings accounts and near 0% loans is too small to make a profit, forcing banks to engage in riskier behavior
- As Gross pointed out, banks need a positive lending spread (net interest margin) to encourage them to advance loans.fn2 If banks don’t lend, they don’t create money either. Quantitative easing boosted asset prices and shrank credit spreads, but most of this newly created money wasn’t lent to consumers or businesses but was deposited by the banks at the Federal Reserve. The fact that the Fed in 2008 started paying interest on excess reserves (i.e. bank deposits at the central bank) gave banks even less reason to lend. The circulation of money through the economy slowed.8 In short, the Fed’s policy of keeping rates close to zero didn’t create inflation, but rather produced a lingering deflation.

- the unintended consequence of unconventional monetary policies was to reduce the economy’s trend growth rate, thereby lowering the natural rate of interest. Although the Federal Reserve didn’t take responsibility for this outcome, central bankers slowly came to understand that the natural rate was on a downward trend. A few years after the crisis, the Federal Open Market Committee – the body which sets the Fed funds rate – started to publish charts of each member’s prediction for the future course of interest rates. These ‘dot plots’, as they were called, showed that America’s monetary policymakers consistently overestimated the future level of interest rates. The FOMC’s median forecast for the ‘long term’ rate (the expected normal level of interest rates) trended downwards over time.9 ([Location 5661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=5661))

The Fed had started out in 2008 by acquiring a few hundred billion dollars’ worth of short-dated Treasury Bills, but later turned to buying bonds with lengthier maturities in order to push down long-term rates.

Even as memories of the financial crisis faded, the pace of the Fed’s securities purchases picked up.13 Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker lamented that the Federal Reserve had ‘extended to the very edge of its lawful and implied power, transcending certain long embedded central banking principles and practices’.14 ([Location 5708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=5708))

The first wave of globalization, which dates from the 1860s to the end of the century, was accompanied by mild deflation and falling long-term interest rates.fn4 During the recent globalization phase, from 1980 onwards, China and other developing countries grabbed an increased share of world trade. Traded goods’ prices declined and millions of manufacturing jobs were ‘off-shored’ to emerging markets. Thus, globalization reduced both inflation and wage growth, which, in turn, allowed Western central banks to reduce interest rates, thereby spurring the greatest bull market in bonds in history.

Under such circumstances, borrowers benefit at the expense of savers. Market forces no longer determine how credit is dispensed. Banks become risk averse, preferring to lend to large corporations and state-related entities. Savers look to protect their wealth from inflation by investing in real estate or taking their money abroad.

But this isn’t how things work in the real world, says Borio. In the real world, banks create credit out of thin air. Savings and investment are two sides of the same coin. Thus, when a bank loan is used for the purposes of investment there occurs an automatic increase in reported savings.27 In China, financial repression stimulated credit growth; much of the new credit was invested, which, in turn, pushed up the savings rate.

- There were countless ways, legal and illegal, for citizens to evade capital controls. In Macau, casinos provided a ‘laundry service’ taking in yuan and paying out in Hong Kong dollars. ([Location 6658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=6658))

- The credit binge launched by the 2008/9 stimulus enhanced Beijing’s sway over the economy. As the state has advanced, productivity growth has declined. Because interest rates neither reflect the return on capital nor credit risk, China’s economy has suffered from the twin evils of capital misallocation and excessive debt. Real estate development, fuelled by low-cost credit, delivered what President Xi called ‘fictional growth’. By 2019 Chinese GDP growth (per capita) had fallen to half its 2007 level.

- The Global Financial Crisis brought about a massive increase in public debt, and rising indebtedness provided monetary policymakers with another reason to maintain low interest rates.2 As long as the yield on government bonds was held below the level of inflation, then, over time national debt could be inflated away. This was the West’s version of financial repression. ([Location 6769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=6769))

- Between 1945 and 1980, interest rates in the United States and the United Kingdom averaged in real terms (i.e., after inflation) minus 3.5 per cent. Negative real rates provided an annual subsidy to the US government equivalent to a fifth of tax revenues. Thanks to financial repression, America’s national debt (relative to GDP) declined by nearly three-quarters. The British liquidated their war debts in a similar fashion.

    - Note: Potential benefit of low interest rates? Likely would need to be accompanied by restricted government spending (so monetary and fiscal partnership). The next section talks about also needing capital controls to prevent money leaving to foreign economies. Why?
- With the prospect of short-term interest rates being held below inflation for years without end, the hedge fund tycoon Ray Dalio anticipated what he called a ‘beautiful deleveraging’.11 Contrary to Dalio’s expectation, public and private debt kept on rising. The lure of financial engineering prompted companies to take on more debt, while the decline in government bond yields removed any incentive to fiscal prudence.

    - Note: Why did this not happen in the post war period, when negative real rates DID lead to widespread deleveraging?
- In Europe, the central bankers’ dominion over the credit markets was most firmly established. In 2014, the European Central Bank launched a programme to provide free long-term finance for banks against the collateral of loans to companies and households.18 By deciding which debt was eligible for support, the ECB effectively directed credit towards what it deemed desirable ends. Two years later, the ECB added the debt of investment-grade corporations to its list of qualifying assets, thereby favouring large companies over small ones.19 Across the Channel, the Bank of England extended its bond purchases to include the securities of large foreign companies on the grounds that they contributed to the UK economy.20 ([Location 6836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=6836))

- A couple of years before the appearance of The Road to Serfdom, Hayek’s Austrian contemporary Joseph Schumpeter published an equally notable book. Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (1942) is best known for introducing the idea of creative destruction (as discussed in Chapter 10). Schumpeter believed that a capitalist economic system would atrophy if it ever became stationary. At which point, Schumpeter predicted, profits and interest would converge towards zero: The bourgeois strata that live on profits and interest would tend to disappear. The management of industry and trade would become a matter of current administration, and the personnel would unavoidably acquire the characteristics of a bureaucracy. Socialism of a very sober type would almost automatically come into being.38 ([Location 6919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=6919))

- Schumpeter believed that capitalism was under attack from intellectuals – a group distinguished by their ‘absence of direct responsibility for practical affairs’, whose ranks were swollen by rising numbers of university graduates filled with a ‘righteous indignation about the wrongs of capitalism’.39 At one stage, Schumpeter poses the question, ‘Can capitalism survive?’ To which he answers, gloomily, ‘No. I do not think it can.’ ([Location 6929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=6929))

- So far, each step we have taken on this new road to serfdom has been incremental and justified on the grounds of expediency. Little thought has been given to the general direction in which we have been travelling. There is no grand master plan, unlike in Marxism, to concentrate minds. Rather, we have blundered – to use Hayek’s term – into greater government control of the economy. And the more we blunder, the more the system appears to fail, which in turn justifies further interventions. ([Location 6950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=6950))

- As Hayek realized, the public’s willingness to accept inequality depends on a shared belief that unequal outcomes reflect either differences in economic contribution or are a matter of luck. Few begrudge the fortunes earned by successful entrepreneurs and sports personalities. But when senior executives gain fabulous wealth by cutting investment and taking on debt, thereby lowering their company’s (and the economy’s) growth prospects, and when laid-off workers are forced to accept lower wages with reduced benefits elsewhere, then resentment against the system starts to build.

- In the early 1930s, Hayek argued that the cure for a credit boom wouldn’t come from lowering interest rates or by running large fiscal deficits. If interest rates had been too low before the crisis, then reducing them further was not the answer. Instead, he believed that interest rates should be allowed to rise, along with savings (which had been too low beforehand). Bad investments should be liquidated, he added. The Austrian economist failed to convince people at the time. Yet Iceland adopted many of Hayek’s prescriptions, out of necessity rather than ideological fervour, and emerged from the crisis in better shape than most.

- The recognition of the insuperable limits to his knowledge ought indeed to teach the student of society a lesson of humility which should guard him against becoming an accomplice in men’s fatal striving to control society – a striving which makes him not only a tyrant over his fellows, but which may well make him the destroyer of a civilization which no brain has designed but which has grown from the free efforts of millions of individuals.fn6 ([Location 7060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=7060))

    - Note: Controlling a complex system that arose from the bottom up using top-down means is impossible. Hayek understood this. Instead, the conditions for efficient bottom-up growth need to be put in place. This involves facilitating individual freedoms and commerce, as well as allowing capital to be allocated naturally (through non state or central bank means) to the appropriate industries
- Warren Buffett agreed that ultra-high valuations were supported by ultra-low interest rates. ‘Interest rates,’ said the Sage of Omaha, ‘basically are to the value of assets what gravity is to matter.’fn1 Once this gravitational force was removed, Dogecoins, NFTs, meme stocks and other speculative assets were free to float into the stratosphere.

- As globalization reverses and China’s workforce declines, inflation is likely to pick up and interest rates will have to rise to contain it.13 Claudio Borio’s ‘epoch-defining seismic rupture’ – a toxic mixture of high inflation, financial and trade protectionism and stagnation – no longer seems such a distant prospect.

- Something is needed to ensure the equality between the amount of tea which sellers are willing to put on to the market and the amount which buyers are willing to take off it; and that something is a certain price of tea. Similarly, something is needed to ensure equality between the amount of money which lenders are willing to put on the market for loans and the amount of money which borrowers are willing to take off it; and that something is a certain rate of interest.14 ([Location 7225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=7225))

- The source of the problem is that, whereas capital is limited, the medium by which savings are transferred – namely, money – can be created without limit by central banks (fiat money) and by commercial banks (fountain-pen money). As a result, the interest rate on money loans becomes detached from savings. ([Location 7232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=7232))

- Hayek envisaged a world in which money was issued by private banks that competed with each other to get their money accepted by the public. Good money would drive out the bad, he predicted. Any bank that offered too little interest would lose clients. ([Location 7235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=7235))
- Central banks are developing digital currencies to compete with free-wheeling cryptos. The central bank digital currencies might be used to acquire government bonds that would provide them with asset-backing. If their issuance was limited to no more than the economy’s trend growth rate, this money would be as good as gold.16 A digital Gold Standard would have some of the advantages, and fewer of the disadvantages, of the classical Gold Standard. One advantage is that central bankers would no longer be able to pursue an active monetary policy. The cost of borrowing would more accurately reflect the supply of and demand for actual savings. Guided by the market’s invisible hand, the rate of interest would find its natural level. ([Location 7242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09NS1CZ7W&location=7242))
