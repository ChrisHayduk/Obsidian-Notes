## Highlights
- perhaps more surprisingly, there was a deep uniformity in the construction of the tissues. Each part of the plant was built, bricolage-like, out of autonomous, independent units—cells. “Each cell leads a double life,” Schleiden would write a year later, “an entirely independent one, belonging to its own development alone; and an incidental one, in so far as it has become part of a plant.” A life within a life. An independent living being—a unit—that forms a part of the whole. A living building block contained within the larger living being.

- Animals and plants—as seemingly different as living organisms could be. Yet, as both Schwann and Schleiden had noticed, the similarity of their tissues under the microscope was uncanny. Schwann’s hunch had been right. That evening in Berlin, he would later recall, the two friends had converged on a universal and essential scientific truth: both animals and plants had a “common means of formation through cells.” ([Location 55](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09RX45W14&location=55))

- But cancer cells don’t “invent” any of these properties. They don’t build anew, they hijack—or, more accurately, the cells that are fittest for survival, growth, and metasisis are naturally selected. The genes and proteins that cells use to generate the building blocks required for growth are appropriated from the genes and proteins that a developing embryo uses to fuel its fierce burst of expansion during the first days of life. The pathways used by the cancer cell to move across vast bodily spaces are commandeered from those that allow inherently mobile cells in the body to move. The genes that enable unfettered cell division are distorted, mutated versions of genes that allow cell division in normal cells. Cancer, in short, is cell biology visualized in a pathological mirror. ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09RX45W14&location=122))

- Emily’s trial involved infusing her body with her own T cells. But these T cells had to be weaponized, via gene therapy, to recognize and kill her cancer. Unlike Sam, who had received drugs to activate immunity inside his body, Emily’s T cells had been extracted and grown outside her body. This form of treatment had been pioneered by the immunologist Michel Sadelain at the Sloan Kettering Institute in New York and by Carl June at the University of Pennsylvania, building on earlier work by the Israeli researcher Zelig Eshhar.

- radical concept swept through biology and medicine, touching virtually every aspect of the two sciences, and altering both forever. Complex living organisms were assemblages of tiny, self-contained, self-regulating units—living compartments, if you will, or “living atoms,” as the Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek called them in 1676. Humans were ecosystems of these living units. We were pixelated assemblages, composites, our existence the result of a cooperative agglomeration. We were a sum of parts.

- The transformation of medicine made possible by our new understanding of cell biology can be broadly divided into four categories. The first is the use of drugs, chemical substances, or physical stimulation to alter the properties of cells—their interactions with one another, their intercommunication, and their behavior. Antibiotics against germs, chemotherapy and immunotherapy for cancer, and the stimulation of neurons with electrodes to modulate nerve cell circuits in the brain fall in this first category. The second is the transfer of cells from body to body (including back into our own bodies), exemplified by blood transfusions, bone marrow transplantation, and in vitro fertilization (IVF). The third is the use of cells to synthesize a substance—insulin or antibodies—that produces a therapeutic effect on an illness. And most recently, there is a fourth category: the genetic modification of cells, followed by transplantation, to create cells, organs, and bodies endowed with new properties.

- In 1922, a fourteen-year-old boy with type 1 diabetes was resuscitated from a coma—born anew, as it were—by the infusion of insulin extracted from the pancreatic cells of a dog. In 2010, when Emily Whitehead received her infusion of CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T cells, or twelve years later, when the first patients with sickle cell anemia are surviving, disease-free, with gene-modified blood stem cells, we are transitioning from the century of the gene to a contiguous, overlapping century of the cell.

- Life’s definition, as it stands now, is akin to a menu. It is not one thing but a series of things, a set of behaviors, a series of processes, not a single property. To be living, an organism must have the capacity to reproduce, to grow, to metabolize, to adapt to stimuli, and to maintain its internal milieu. Complex, multicellular living beings also possess what I might call “emergent” properties: properties that emerge from systems of cells, such as mechanisms to defend themselves against injury and invasion, organs with specialized functions, physiologic systems of communication between organs and even sentience and cognition. And it is not a coincidence that all these properties repose, ultimately, in the cells, or systems of cells. In a sense, then, one might define life as having cells, and cells as having life.

- What is a cell, anyway? In a narrow sense, a cell is an autonomous living unit that acts as a decoding machine for a gene. Genes provide instructions—code, if you will—to build proteins, the molecules that perform virtually all the work in a cell. Proteins enable biological reactions, coordinate signals within the cell, form its structural elements, and turn genes on and off to regulate a cell’s identity, metabolism, growth, and death. They are the central functionaries in biology, the molecular machines that enable life.I ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09RX45W14&location=289))

- By decoding, I mean that molecules within a cell read certain sections of the genetic code, like musicians in an orchestra reading their parts of a musical score—the cell’s individual song—thereby enabling a gene’s instructions to become physically manifest in the actual protein. Or, put more simply, a gene carries the code; a cell deciphers that code. A cell thus transforms information into form; genetic code into proteins. A gene without a cell is lifeless—an instruction manual stored inside an inert molecule, a musical score without a musician, a lonely library with no one to read the books within it. A cell brings materiality and physicality to a set of genes. A cell enlivens genes. ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09RX45W14&location=297))

- a cell is not merely a gene-decoding machine. Having unpacked the code by synthesizing a select set of proteins that is encoded in its genes, a cell becomes an integrating machine. A cell uses this set of proteins (and the biochemical products made by proteins) in conjunction with one another to start coordinating its function, its behavior (movement, metabolism, signaling, delivering nutrients to other cells, surveying for foreign objects), to achieve the properties of life. And that behavior, in turn, manifests as the behavior of the organism. ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09RX45W14&location=303))

- And finally, a cell is a dividing machine. Molecules within the cell—proteins, again—initiate the process of duplicating the genome. The internal organization of the cell changes. Chromosomes, where the genetic material of a cell is physically located, divide. Cell division is what drives growth, repair, regeneration, and, ultimately, reproduction, among the fundamental, defining features of life.

- The Yale University virologist Akiko Iwasaki told me that the central pathology caused by SARS-CoV2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) was “immunological misfiring”—a dysregulation of immune cells. I had not even heard the term before, but its immensity hit me: at its core, the pandemic, too, was a disease of cells. Yes, there was the virus, but viruses are inert, lifeless, without cells. Our cells had awoken the plague and brought it to life. To understand crucial features of the pandemic, we would need to understand not just the idiosyncrasies of the virus but also the biology of immune cells and their discontents.

- But if you looked down a microscope at your skin and mine, or your liver and mine, you would find them strikingly alike. And you’d realize that all of us were, in fact, built out of living units: cells. The first cell gave rise to more cells, and then divided to form even more, until our livers and guts and brains—all the elaborate anatomical architectures in the body—were gradually formed. When did we realize that humans were, in fact, composites of independent, living units? Or that these units are the basis of all the functions that the body is capable of—in other words, that our physiology reposes, ultimately, in cellular physiology? And conversely, when did we posit that our medical fates and futures were intimately linked to the changes in these living units? That our diseases are consequences of cellular pathology?

- Was there some deeper organizing principle that connected these organs, and their diffuse and mystifying disorders? Could one even think of human pathology in a systematic manner? Perhaps the answer was not to be found in visible anatomy but rather in microscopic anatomy. Indeed, by analogy, eighteenth-century chemists had already begun to discover that the properties of matter—the combustibility of hydrogen or the fluidity of water—arose from the emergent properties of invisible particles, molecules, and atoms that comprised them. Was biology perhaps similarly organized? ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09RX45W14&location=465))

- Hooke’s intelligence was phosphorescent and elastic, like a rubber band that glows as it stretches. He would enter disciplines and then expand and illuminate them as if by an internal light. He wrote extensively about mechanics, optics, and material sciences. In the aftermath of the Great Fire of London, which raged for five days in September 1666, destroying four-fifths of the city, Hooke helped the esteemed architect Christopher Wren survey and reconstruct buildings. He built a powerful new telescope through which he could visualize the surface of Mars, and he studied and classified fossils.

- Hooke’s interest in microscopy eventually dwindled. His peripatetic intellect needed to roam widely, and he returned to optics, mechanics, and physics. Indeed, Hooke’s interest in virtually everything may have been his critical failing. The Royal Society’s motto, Nullius in verba, translated loosely as “Take no one’s word for evidence,” was his personal mantra. He loped from one scientific discipline to the next, offering potent insights, believing no one’s word, claiming dominion over critical parts of a science, but never asserting complete authority over any one subject. He had built himself on the model of the Aristotelian philosopher-scientist—an inquirer into all matters of the world, an adjudicator of all evidence—rather than the contemporary vision of the scientist as the authority on a single subject, and his reputation suffered as a result.

- Part of the explanation for this valley of silence has to do with the time required to develop instruments and model systems to answer these questions. Genetics had to await the work of the biologist Thomas Morgan, who explored the inheritance of traits in fruit flies in the 1920s to prove the physical existence of the gene, and, eventually, the birth of X-ray crystallography, the technique used to decipher the three-dimensional structure of molecules such as DNA, in the 1950s, to understand what genes look like in physical form. Atomic theory, first enunciated by John Dalton in the early 1800s, had to await the development of the cathode-ray tube in 1890, and the mathematical equations required to model quantum physics in the early twentieth century to elucidate the structure of the atom. Cell biology had to wait for centrifugation, biochemistry, and electron microscopy. ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09RX45W14&location=682))

- You have to think of a cell in a different manner: not as an object under a lens but as a functional site for all physiological chemical reactions, as an organizing unit for all tissues, and as the unifying locus for physiology and pathology. You have to move from a continuous organization of the biological world to a description that involves discontinuous, discrete, autonomous elements that unify that world.

- What did cells do? “A cell is […] a kind of laboratory,” he posited. Pause for a moment to contemplate the scope of that thought. Using no more than basic assumptions about chemistry and cells, Raspail deduced that a cell performs chemical processes to make tissues and organs function. In other words, it enables physiology. He imagined the cell as the site for the reactions that sustain life. But biochemistry was in its infancy, and so the chemistry and reactions that occurred within this cellular “laboratory” were invisible to Raspail. He could describe it only as a theory. A hypothesis.

- The concept of the cell as a laboratory for an organism’s physiology returns to me: every cell growing in one of my incubators is a lab within a lab. The T cells that I had seen under the microscope in the Oxford lab were “Surveillance labs,” swimming in fluid to find viral pathogens hiding within other cells. The sperm cells that Leeuwenhoek had seen under his scope were “Information labs,” collecting hereditary information from a male, packaging it in DNA, and attaching a powerful swimming motor to deliver it to the egg cell for reproduction. The cell, as it were, is experimenting with physiology, passing molecules in and out, making chemicals and destroying chemicals. It is the laboratory of reactions that enables life.

- Schleiden and Schwann proposed the first two tenets of cell theory: All living organisms are composed of one or more cells. The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms. ([Location 802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09RX45W14&location=802))
- Cells came from cells. And cellular physiology is the basis of normal physiology. If Virchow’s first tenet concerned normal physiology, his second was its converse; it reconceived medicine’s understanding of abnormality. What if dysfunctions in cells, he began to wonder, were responsible for malfunctions in the body? What if all pathology were cellular pathology? ([Location 877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09RX45W14&location=877))
- Generations of anatomic pathologists had thought about diseases as the breakdown of tissues, organs, and organ systems. Virchow argued that they had missed the real source of the illness. Since cells were the unit blocks of life and physiology, Virchow reasoned, then the pathological changes observed in diseased tissues and organs should be traced back to pathological changes in the units of the affected tissue—in other words, to cells. To understand pathology, doctors needed to look for essential disruptions not just in visible organs but in the organ’s invisible units. ([Location 882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09RX45W14&location=882))
- Virchow had refined Schwann and Schleiden’s cell theory by adding three more crucial tenets to the two founding ones (“All living organisms are composed of one or more cells,” and “The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms”): All cells come from other cells (Omnis cellula e cellula). Normal physiology is the function of cellular physiology. Disease, the disruption of physiology, is the result of the disrupted physiology of the cell. These five principles would form the pillars of cell biology and cellular medicine. They would revolutionize our understanding of the human body as assemblages of these units. They would complete the atomist conception of the human body, with the cell as its fundamental, “atomic” unit.
