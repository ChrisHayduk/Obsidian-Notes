- The charge that the rigidity of the prewar plans created doomsday machines that once set in motion could not be stopped has had considerable currency as one of the causes, if not the main cause of the Great War. Yet, complex as they were, railway and mobilization schedules could be and indeed were altered in their details every year by the military as more information came in, new lines were opened, or strategic objectives were modified. And their overall goals could have been changed or alternative plans drawn up. After the war, General Groener of the German general staff’s Railway Section claimed that he and his men could have produced new plans in July 1914 to mobilize only against Russia and not France—and done so without a delay that would have been dangerous to Germany.

- What the plans did do to bring about the Great War was put additional pressure on the decision-makers by shortening the time in which decisions had to be taken. Whereas in the eighteenth century and even the first part of the nineteenth, governments usually had months to think about whether or not they wanted or needed to go to war, they now had days. Thanks to the industrial revolution, once mobilization started armies could be at their frontiers and be ready to fight within a week, in the case of Germany, or in the case of Russia with its greater distances, just over two weeks. The European powers had a pretty good idea of how long each of them would take to mobilize and be ready to fight. It was critical not to get too far behind in the process. A partially completed mobilization when the enemy was on the frontiers and already fully mobilized was the nightmare of Europe’s military and one which many civilians came to share.

- once a neighboring power started mobilizing or even showing signs of preparations it was hard for its neighbors to resist mobilizing as well. Not to do anything could be suicide but mobilizing too late was seen as not much better. ([Location 6065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNQ9PFK&location=6065))

- While the increasing size of the continental armies obliged them to draw more officers from the urban middle classes, this shift did not lead to a greater enthusiasm and respect for technical or academic prowess; indeed the middle-class officers seem to have absorbed aristocratic values, in taking up dueling for example, not the other way round.

- the war that Europeans were being asked to face by 1900 was different in significant ways from those of the past. The industrial revolution had produced weapons that were more powerful, more reliable and more accurate and their much greater range meant that soldiers often did not see the enemies they were killing. It was much easier to defend positions than to attack: as yet the technologies to overcome a strong defense, such as aircraft and armored vehicles, did not exist. As a French general reportedly said after the long-drawn-out Battle of Verdun in the Great War, “Three men and a machine gun can stop a battalion of heroes.” ([Location 6107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNQ9PFK&location=6107))

- Soldiers in Napoleon’s time had muskets which, with good training, they could reload—standing up—and fire three times a minute, and which were only accurate up to forty-five meters. (That is why it had been both necessary and possible for soldiers to hold their fire until they could see the whites of the enemy’s eyes.) By 1870 the soldiers had rifles which were accurate up to almost half a kilometer; what is more they could load and fire six times a minute, and from the breech as they lay down, which meant that they were not exposed to enemy fire. By 1900 rifles were accurate—and lethal—over a greater distance, sometimes even up to a kilometer, and the new machine guns could fire hundreds of rounds a minute. The numbers had climbed and were continuing to climb all round: field artillery, which had an average range of just over half a kilometer in 1800, had almost seven kilometers in 1900; heavier guns, often mounted on railway undercarriages, had a range of ten kilometers. So attackers had to survive several kilometers of shell fire then several hundred meters of intense rifle and machine-gun fire on their way towards the enemy.

- Bloch warned about this last, the zone of fire, and the growing advantage of the defense, and about the likelihood of stalemates on the battlefield that would last for months or years. Yet Europe’s military planners dismissed his work. After all, as a Jew by birth, a banker, and a pacifist he was everything they tended to dislike.

- European military observers had gone to the American Civil War of 1861–5 or to that between Turkey and Russia in 1877 and seen for themselves how a combination of well-prepared defensive positions including trenches in combination with rapid firing had devastated the attackers and caused much larger losses among them than the defenders. At the Battle of Fredericksburg in 1862, to take only one of many examples, the Union threw waves of soldiers against well-defended Confederate positions. All the attacks failed and the Union lost over twice as many soldiers as the Confederacy. It is said that the Union wounded scattered across the battlefield begged their comrades not to continue their fruitless attacks.

- EUROPE’S MILITARY PLANNERS did their best to explain away the problems of the offense and the growing cost in terms of life. Recent wars had not, for example, been fought properly as the most advanced, European armies would fight them. “Those savage encounters do not deserve the name of war,” a European general said of the American Civil War to Bloch, “and I have dissuaded my officers from reading the published accounts of them.” ([Location 6154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNQ9PFK&location=6154))

- Military history, which was treated with reverence in the European military as the source of wisdom about war, was called in to support the arguments.32 The battles with clear outcomes, Leipzig in 1813 or Sedan in 1870 for example, tended, however, to get more attention than inconclusive or defensive ones.

- The reluctance of Europe’s military to come to terms with the new ways of war can be explained partly by bureaucratic inertia: changing such things as tactics, drills, or training methods is time-consuming and unsettling. The very cohesiveness armies demanded of their officers led to a collective mentality where originality and loyalty were prized less than being a good team player.

- Yet we should not assume that the military planners before 1914 were unique in their dogged insistence on the offensive; history and the present are littered with examples of the striking capacity of human beings to overlook, minimize, or explain away evidence that does not fit comfortably with deeply held assumptions and theories. What some historians have christened the cult of the offensive grew stronger if anything before 1914 in the thinking of Europe’s military planners (and to be fair in that of the Americans and the Japanese as well), perhaps because the alternative—that war had evolved to a point where there would be huge losses and mutual attrition without a clear victory for either side—was so unpalatable and so difficult to comprehend.

- Character, motivation, morale, these were widely seen before 1914 as the key ingredients for the success of the offensive. In stressing the importance of the psychological factor, the military drew on thinking current in the wider European society of the times. The work of Nietzsche or Bergson, for example, had awakened interest in the power of the human will. ([Location 6190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNQ9PFK&location=6190))

- In the armed forces as well as in the militaristic organizations of civilian society such as youth movements, the emphasis on inculcating such values as self-sacrifice went beyond giving fresh advantage to the offensive in war. It was also as much about overcoming the deficiencies of modern society and reversing what many, especially in the old ruling classes, felt to be the degeneration of the race and the deterioration of society. For those officers from those classes, a decreasing number but still an influential group, the attempt offered a way back to what they felt was a better society and one in which their values were paramount. That distinguished Victorian soldier Sir Garnet Wolseley, from the Anglo-Irish gentry, a class which shared many of the values of the German Junkers, advocated conscription for Britain on the grounds that it was an “invigorating antidote” against the weakening effects of modern society: “National training keeps healthy and robust the manhood of a state, and in saving it from degeneration nobly serves the cause of civilisation.” ([Location 6205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNQ9PFK&location=6205))

- The striking absence of serious planning before 1914 for a long war, whether stockpiling materials or drawing up measures to manage the economy, is clear evidence that civilian and military leaders in Europe simply did not want to confront that nightmare of defeat and social upheaval.50 At best they hoped that even a stalemated war of attrition would not last that long; on this the military across Europe agreed with Bloch, that the resources would run out and the war effort collapse.

- Under Germany’s war plan in 1914, it needed to get troops into Luxembourg and Belgium before any declaration of war, and that indeed is what happened.53 And the plans themselves contributed to the international tensions by bringing armed forces closer to war readiness and encouraging an arms race. What may seem like a reasonable way of protecting oneself can look very different from the other side of the border.

- As Schlieffen saw it, his duty was to devise the best military plan for Germany; he left diplomacy, which like most of the general staff he saw as useful merely for preparing the ground for war, to the civilians.

- The direction of Germany’s overall strategy and the coordination of the key parts, both civil and military, of the government needed a Bismarck but there was no one of his stature before 1914. Bismarck himself was in part to blame for leaving behind a system where the lines of control were not clearly drawn and where there was little will to draw them. The only institution capable of providing coordination and overall direction was the monarchy but Wilhelm was not the man to do it.

- The two men rode side by side and Moltke revealed that the cause of his concern was Schlieffen’s retirement: “His Majesty insists on making me his successor and everything in me dislikes the thought of this appointment.” Moltke felt, he told Bülow, that he did not possess the right qualities for such a demanding post: “I lack the power of rapid decision; I am too reflective, too scrupulous, or if you like, conscientious for such a post. I lack the capacity for risking all on a single throw.”23 ([Location 6466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNQ9PFK&location=6466))

- The other key part of Schlieffen’s legacy was not a final plan but an overall strategic direction and method of planning. Year by year in the two decades before 1914, the general staff tested its plans in field maneuvers—some with thousands of men and their equipment—war games, or on paper. All were analyzed for issues, gaps, or shortcomings, and the results cycled back into the planning process. On April 1 every year, each unit of the German army had its updated plans and orders. “They have turned war,” Kessler rightly said of the general staff, “into a great bureaucratic business enterprise.”30 And, as with other great enterprises, there was a danger that process was becoming more important than broader strategic thinking and that fundamental assumptions including the need for a two-front war went unexamined and unchallenged.

- In 1914, even after the improvement in the railways, it still took twenty-six days fully to mobilize the armies in the European part of Russia while it took Austria-Hungary sixteen days and Germany twelve.75 That discrepancy was going to put additional pressure on the Tsar to order Russian mobilization early in the crisis that summer.

- What France needed if a general war broke out was an early Russian attack on Germany in the east to take the pressure off French forces in the west.

The policy of moderation and cooperation in the Balkans which had existed between the two powers lay in shreds, to the ultimate ruin of both. What they had long feared, armed confrontation in the Balkans, nearly happened in 1908, again in 1912 and 1913, and finally broke out in 1914 and brought most of Europe down with it.

- Milan managed to alienate Serbian nationalists by his subservience to Austria-Hungary and shock even his supporters by quarreling openly with his Russian-born wife in various Belgrade cafés. In 1889, by now divorced from her, Milan finally managed to abdicate in favor of his thirteen-year-old son, Alexander. Unfortunately for the family and for Serbia, the boy grew up to be a chip off the parental block. In 1900 he married an older woman with a very shady reputation. In 1903 both were murdered, along with the Prime Minister and the Minister of War, in a particularly brutal fashion by nationalist officers. Peter Karageorgevi?, from a rival dynasty, became King and, after some political turbulence, the intensely nationalist Radicals under the cagey and cunning Nikola Paši? took over the government which they were to dominate until the end of the Great War. The assassination not only set Serbia on a new path of confrontation with Austria-Hungary, it helped to build the chain of events which led to the summer of 1914.

The temptation for Germany’s new Chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, and his colleagues to have a good international crisis to bring all Germans together in support of their government was considerable.8 According to Bülow, his successor longed for a dramatic success such as the one that Germany and Austria-Hungary enjoyed over the Bosnian annexation. Bülow, who came to resent and despise Bethmann as a weakling, also claimed that Bethmann said rather pathetically during the handover: “I shall soon get the hang of foreign policy.” ([Location 8207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNQ9PFK&location=8207))

The taxation system badly needed reforming to produce the tax revenue the government needed for the armed forces and its social programs.

- In the year from the outbreak of the First Balkan War to the autumn of 1913, Russia and Austria-Hungary had come close to war on several occasions, and the shadow of a more general conflict had fallen across Europe as a whole as their allies had waited in the wings. Although the powers had in the end been able to manage the crises, their peoples, leaders and publics alike had become accustomed to the idea of war, and as something that might happen sooner rather than later. When Conrad threatened to resign because he felt he had been snubbed by Franz Ferdinand, Moltke begged him to reconsider: “Now, when we are moving towards a conflict, you must remain.”116 Russia and Austria-Hungary had used preparations for war, especially mobilization, for deterrence but also to put pressure on each other, and, in the case of Austria-Hungary, on Serbia. Threats had worked this time because none of the three countries had been prepared to call the bluffs of the others and because, in the end, the voices for maintaining the peace were stronger than those for war. What was dangerous for the future was that each of Austria-Hungary and Russia was left thinking that such threats might work again. Or, and this was equally dangerous, they decided that next time they would not back down. ([Location 9214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNQ9PFK&location=9214))

Riezler was shocked by the older man’s pessimism as he lamented the state of the world and of Germany. German society, Bethmann felt, was in moral and intellectual decline and the existing political and social order seemed incapable of renewing itself. “Everything,” he said sadly, “has become so very old.” The future too looked bleak: Russia, “an increasingly heavy nightmare,” would grow still stronger while Austria-Hungary declined to the point where it was no longer capable of fighting with Germany as an ally.

Over half a century later a young and inexperienced American president faced his own crisis and his own choices. In 1962 when the Soviet Union placed military forces on Cuba, including missiles capable of striking the eastern seaboard of the United States with nuclear warheads, John F. Kennedy was under intense pressure from his own military to take action even at the risk of an all-out war with the Soviet Union. He resisted, partly because he had learned from the previous year’s fiasco of the Bay of Pigs that the military were not always right but also because he had just read The Guns of August, Barbara Tuchman’s extraordinary account of how Europe had blundered into the Great War. He chose to open negotiations with the Soviet Union and the world backed away from the brink. ([Location 11568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNQ9PFK&location=11568))

- Although there are many myths about the Great War, in August 1914 the soldiers did indeed tell their families that they would be home for Christmas. At the British Staff College at Camberley where the graduating students waited amidst the usual garden parties, cricket matches and picnics for their orders, word came at last that they were to take up their appointments, most with the British Expeditionary Force that was going to the Continent. The college itself was closed until further notice and its instructors were also given staff posts; the authorities thought there was no need to carry on training more officers for a short war.4 The warnings of experts such as Ivan Bloch and Moltke himself or of pacifists such as Bertha von Suttner and Jean Jaurès that offensives would end in stalemates with neither side strong enough to overcome the other, while societies were drained of their resources, from men to munitions, were forgotten, at least for the time being, as the European powers marched into war. Most people, from those in command to the ordinary citizen, assumed that it would be short, like the Franco-Prussian War, for example, where it took the armies of the German alliance less than two months to force the surrender of France. (That the fighting then dragged on because the French people took up the struggle was another matter.) Financial experts, whether bankers or finance ministers, took it for granted that the war would have to be short: the disruption of trade and the inability of governments to borrow money as the international capital markets dried up would mean that impending bankruptcy would make it impossible for the belligerents to carry on fighting. As Norman Angell, in his Great Illusion, warned, even if Europe was so foolish as to go to war, the resulting economic chaos and domestic misery would rapidly force the warring nations to negotiate a peace. What few realized—although Bloch had—was that Europe’s governments had an untested but great capacity to squeeze resources out of their societies, whether through taxation, managing their economies or freeing up men for the front by using the labor of women, and that Europeans themselves had a stoicism and doggedness which could keep them fighting through the long years to come even as the terrible losses mounted. What is surprising about the Great War is not that European societies and individuals eventually buckled under the strain—and not all did, or not completely—but that Russia, Germany and Austria-Hungary endured for so long before they collapsed into revolution or mutiny or despair.

- As the German forces poured through Belgium and Luxembourg on their way into northern France, the German war plans appeared to be unfolding as they should. Not quite, however. Belgium’s decision to resist slowed the pace of the German advance. The main fortress at Liège fell on August 7 but twelve more had to be taken one by one. Belgian resistance also meant that Germany had to leave troops behind as it advanced. The German army on the great right wing which was to swoop across the Meuse towards the Channel and then swing south towards Paris and so bring a stunning victory was both weaker and slower than had been planned.

- Industries, national wealth, labor, science, technology, even the arts had all been harnessed to the war effort. Europe’s progress, which it had celebrated so proudly at the Paris Exposition of 1900, had enabled it to perfect the means to mobilize its great resources in order to destroy itself.

- Although the victorious powers had their share of upheavals—there were violent strikes and demonstrations in France, Italy, and Britain by 1918—the old order held there, for the time being. But Europe collectively was no longer the center of the world. It had spent down its great wealth and exhausted its power. The peoples of its empires who had largely acquiesced in rule from outside were stirring, their confidence that their foreign masters knew best shaken irremediably by the four years of savagery on Europe’s battlefields. New nationalist leaders, many of them soldiers who had witnessed for themselves what European civilization could produce, demanded self-government now and not in some far-off future. Britain’s “white” dominions were content to stay within the empire but only on the condition that they had increased autonomy. New players from outside Europe were taking a greater part in world affairs. In the Far East, Japan had grown in both power and confidence and dominated its neighborhood. Across the Atlantic the United States was now a major world power, its industries and farms stimulated to even more growth by the war and with New York increasingly the center of world finance. Americans saw Europe as old, decadent and finished—and many Europeans agreed with them. ([Location 11695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CNQ9PFK&location=11695))

- The Great War marked a break in Europe’s history. Before 1914, Europe for all its problems had hope that the world was becoming a better place and that human civilization was advancing. After 1918 that faith was no longer possible for Europeans. As they looked back at their lost world before the war, they could feel only a sense of loss and waste.
