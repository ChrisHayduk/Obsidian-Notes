## Highlights
- the brothers had tremendous energy, and working hard every day but Sunday was a way of life, and if not on the job then at home on “improvements.” ([Location 65](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=65))

- They could be highly demanding and critical of each other, disagree to the point of shouting “something terrible.” ([Location 70](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=70))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Friction to produce innovation. Trial ideas by fire
- Wilbur was more serious by nature, more studious and reflective. His memory of what he had seen and heard, and so much that he read, was astonishing. ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=76))

- Wilbur also, it was agreed, had “unusual presence,” and remained imperturbable under almost any circumstance, “never rattled,” his father was proud to say. He was an exceptional public speaker and lucid writer, which seemed out of context for someone so often silent, and though reluctant to speak in public, when he did his remarks were invariably articulate, to the point, and quite often memorable. In his professional correspondence, the innumerable proposals and reports he wrote, and in private correspondence no less, his vocabulary and use of language were of the highest order, due in large measure to standards long insisted upon by his father. It had proven an ability of utmost importance to his and his brother’s unprecedented accomplishments. ([Location 80](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=80))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Public speaking and strong writing skills are vital
- That Wilbur, in the early stages of their enterprise, wrote nearly all letters concerning their interests in the first person, as if he were operating entirely on his own, seems not to have bothered Orville in the least. ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=88))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: The voice of the operation gets an outsized share of the credit
- What the two had in common above all was unity of purpose and unyielding determination. They had set themselves on a “mission.” ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=101))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Use mission and purpose to motivate your work
- He was an unyielding abstainer, which was rare on the frontier, a man of rectitude and purpose—all of which could have served as a description of Milton himself and Wilbur and Orville as well. ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=134))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Discipline is the root of success
- From wide reading and observations of life, he had acquired what seemed an inexhaustible supply of advice on behavior, habits good and bad, things to beware of in life, goals to strive for. ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=180))

- All the money anyone needs is just enough to prevent one from being a burden on others. ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=185))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Wilbur remained a recluse, more or less homebound, for fully three years—three years when he began reading as never before. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=214))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Reading is THE meta skill
- The Wright family book collection, however, was neither modest nor commonplace. Bishop Wright, a lifelong lover of books, heartily championed the limitless value of reading. ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=234))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Between formal education at school and informal education at home, it would seem he put more value on the latter. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=236))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Self-directed learning more important than classroom learning
- Wilbur—and particularly during his homebound lacuna—read just about everything, but had a particular love of history. ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=245))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Wide reading interests leads to varied talent
- Years later, a friend told Orville that he and his brother would always stand as an example of how far Americans with no special advantages could advance in the world. “But it isn’t true,” Orville responded emphatically, “to say we had no special advantages . . . the greatest thing in our favor was growing up in a family where there was always much encouragement to intellectual curiosity.” ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=257))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Fostering intellectual curiosity changes everything
- Do not wait for the boy to grow up before you begin to treat him as an equal. A proper amount of confidence, and words of encouragement and advice . . . give him to understand that you trust him in many ways, helps to make a man of him long before he is a man in either stature or years. . . . ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=277))

- In 1895, their third year in business, they moved to a corner building at 22 South Williams Street, with a showroom on the street level and space for a machine shop upstairs. There, on the second floor, the brothers began making their own model bicycles, available to order. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=362))

    - Note: Move from selling repackaged solutions to creating something from the ground up. Also vertical integration of manufacturing and selling
- “What we are seeking is the means of free motion in the air, in any direction.” And only by flying oneself could one achieve “proper insight” into all that was involved. To do this, one had to be on “intimate” terms with the wind. ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=401))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Intimate, first hand knowledge is unbeatable. Subconscious and intuitive experience beats rational knowledge
- News of Lilienthal’s death, Wilbur later wrote, aroused in him as nothing had an interest that had remained passive from childhood. His reading on the flight of birds became intense. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=419))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Interest leads to reading leads to innovation
- Marey’s serious, largely technical study led Wilbur to read more of the kind, including such treatises as J. Bell Pettigrew’s Animal Locomotion; or Walking, Swimming, and Flying, with a Dissertation on Aeronautics. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=428))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Diving deep into the literature of a specific area puts you in the top 0.01% of understanding. It only takes a few books in a narrow area to have way more knowledge than almost anyone
- Wilbur was to draw upon and quote Pettigrew for years. Like the inspiring lectures of a great professor, the book had opened his eyes and started him thinking in ways he never had. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=437))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Creativity is built on the back of previous knowledge. You can only do something truly new and innovative if you know what came before
- Orville proceeded with the same reading list. They “read up on aeronautics as a physician would read his books,” Bishop Wright would attest proudly. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=439))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Disciplined reading is the root of their success
- I am about to begin a systematic study of the subject in preparation for practical work to which I expect to devote what time I can spare from my regular business. I wish to obtain such papers as the Smithsonian Institution has published on this subject, and if possible a list of other works in print in the English language. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=468))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: When books have been exhausted, dive deep into research papers. This will bring you to the edge of human knowledge
- In no way did any of this discourage or deter Wilbur and Orville Wright, any more than the fact that they had had no college education, no formal technical training, no experience working with anyone other than themselves, no friends in high places, no financial backers, no government subsidies, and little money of their own. Or the entirely real possibility that at some point, like Otto Lilienthal, they could be killed. ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=509))

- according to the U.S. Patent Office, Dayton ranked first in the country relative to population in the creation of new patents. ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=520))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Live in an innovation center so that you’re exposed to innovation
- Among the material the Smithsonian provided him was an English translation of a book titled L’Empire de l’Air, published in Paris in 1881. It had been written by a French farmer, poet, and student of flight, Louis Pierre Mouillard. Nothing Wilbur had yet read so affected him. He would long consider it “one of the most remarkable pieces of aeronautical literature” ever published. ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=527))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: It only takes one book to change everything
- They would design and build their own experimental glider-kite, drawing on much they had read, much they had observed about birds in flight, and, importantly, from considerable time thinking. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=551))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Reading, observation, thinking, and experimentation. Steps to success
- The chief need was skill rather than machinery. It was impossible to fly without both knowledge and skill—of this Wilbur was already certain—and skill came only from experience—experience in the air. He calculated that in the five years Lilienthal had devoted to gliders and gliding, he spent a total of only five hours in actual flight. It was hardly enough and not how he and Orville would proceed. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=564))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Combine book knowledge with real world experience. You need both, but experience trumps all
- With “wing warping,” or “wing twisting,” as it was sometimes referred to, Wilbur had already made an immensely important and altogether original advance toward their goal. ([Location 572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=572))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- In another letter to the Bishop, he tried to describe what the glider amounted to, stressing that it was to have no motor but depend on the wind only, that the central objective was to solve the problem of balance, and that he knew exactly what he was about, both in building the glider and what he expected to achieve with the tests to come. All this was remarkably clear and concise, and, as time would show, a stunning example of extraordinary prescience. ([Location 692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=692))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Vision and reading led by that vision brings foresight
- When once a machine is under proper control under all conditions, the motor problem will be quickly solved. ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=698))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Identify the key obstacles and solve them. Everything else will fall into place
- “The man who wishes to keep at the problem long enough to really learn anything positively must not take dangerous risks. Carelessness and overconfidence are usually more dangerous than deliberately accepted risks.” ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=702))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- New to such experimental work as they were, the brothers had yet to realize the need for keeping records of all they did. ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=721))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Must record observations in order to adequately learn from them. Applies to business too
- Their self-reliance was put to the test. They lived mainly on local eggs, tomatoes, and hot biscuits, though these had to be made without milk, so “pitiable” were the local cows. The only things that thrived on the Outer Banks, Orville decided, were bedbugs, mosquitoes, and wood ticks. Wilbur longed especially for butter and coffee, corn bread and bacon. ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=749))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Frugality as a tenant of entrepreneurship
- Far from home, on their own in a way they had never been, the brothers seemed to sense as they never had the adventure of life. Orville would later say that even with all the adversities they had to face, it was the happiest time they had ever known. ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=756))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Solvable adversity and progress towards solving a compelling problem are the roots of fulfillment
- “Learning the secret of flight from a bird,” Orville would say, “was a good deal like learning the secret of magic from a magician.” ([Location 786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=786))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Others as well had come to see them as more than mere eccentrics. Life on the Outer Banks was harsh. Making ends meet was a constant struggle. Hard workers were greatly admired and in the words of John T. Daniels, the Wrights were “two of the workingest boys” ever seen, “and when they worked, they worked. . . . They had their whole heart and soul in what they were doing.” ([Location 807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=807))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Determination and resilience are key for entrepreneurs
- It was October 19, and after nearly four years of concentrated study and effort by the brothers, it proved a day of days. ([Location 819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=819))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: FOUR YEARS from starting research/reading to creating flight. Focus intently and passionately on a specific problem, and nothing is impossible. Does drug discovery seem so hard if two brothers can solve the problem of flight without any formal education, only learning from esoteric books?
- Such was the torture of the night that followed, Orville vowed that come morning they would head for home. By morning, however, their characteristic resolve returned. The demon mosquitoes had diminished appreciably and in the days to come grew fewer still. But the torment they had been through would never be forgotten. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=889))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Determination through any and all adversity
- As tiresome as anything for the sons of Bishop Wright was to hear Huffaker go on about “character building,” rather than hard work, being the great aim in life. The more they learned about the glider he had designed and planned to test but never did, the more they considered it a joke. ([Location 904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=904))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: You need to actually build. Just talking is pitiful
- To all present but Wilbur and Orville this flight seemed a huge success. To the brothers it was disappointing. The machine had not performed as expected, not, in fact, as well as the one of the year before. Wilbur had had to use the full power of the rudder (today referred to as the elevator) to keep from plowing into the ground or rising so high as to lose headway. Something was “radically wrong.” ([Location 913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=913))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Success is not linear. There will be setbacks. The important thing is to learn and move closer towards the goal
- For all the time and study he had devoted to the science of gliding, he himself had never physically ventured into the air. ([Location 936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=936))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: The doers outcompete the theorizers
- it is clear from a few of their later comments that they were as down in spirit about their work as they had ever been, and especially Wilbur. It was not just that their machine had performed so poorly, or that so much still remained to be solved, but that so many of the long-established, supposedly reliable calculations and tables prepared by the likes of Lilienthal, Langley, and Chanute—data the brothers had taken as gospel—had proven to be wrong and could no longer be trusted. Clearly those esteemed authorities had been guessing, “groping in the dark.” The accepted tables were, in a word, “worthless.” ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=947))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Accepted wisdom might turn out to be false when facing the real world through experiment. Lots of things can look good in theory
- Wilbur’s gloom on the train was only momentary. As Orville said, “He was at work the following day and it seemed to me was more hopeful and determined than ever.” ([Location 959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=959))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Use disappointment to further your resolve
- The “boys” were working every night on their “scientific” investigations, Katharine reported to their father. “We don’t hear anything but flying machine . . . from morning till night.” ([Location 962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=962))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- If one were looking for perfect safety, he said, one would do well to sit on the fence and watch the birds. “But if you really wish to learn, you must mount a machine and become acquainted with its tricks by actual trial.” ([Location 1001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1001))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Experience trumps everything
- Noting that Lilienthal, over a period of five years, had spent no more than five hours in actual gliding, he said the wonder was not that he had done so little, but that he had accomplished so much. What if a bicycle rider tried to ride through a crowded city after only five hours’ practice, spread out in bits of ten seconds over a period of five years? ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1004))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Hours of deliberate practice (actual applied practice to a specific piece of the goal) is what matters
- Meanwhile, an article in the September issue of the popular McClure’s Magazine written by Simon Newcomb, a distinguished astronomer and professor at Johns Hopkins University, dismissed the dream of flight as no more than a myth. And were such a machine devised, he asked, what useful purpose could it possibly serve? “The first successful flyer will be the handiwork of a watchmaker, and will carry nothing heavier than an insect.” ([Location 1018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1018))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Experts sometimes can’t see the innovation happening around them. Entrenched views and interests can be hard to upend
- With their former trust in the calculations of Lilienthal and Chanute shattered, the brothers set out that autumn of 1901 to crack the code of aeronautics themselves. It was a brave decision and a crucial turning point. ([Location 1022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1022))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Overturn old wisdom, trust your inventiveness
- For nearly two months the brothers tested some thirty-eight wing surfaces, setting the “balances” or “airfoils”—the ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1033))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: The wind tunnel enables rapid testing
- Octave Chanute was astonished by what Wilbur had to report. “It is perfectly marvelous to me how quickly you get results with your testing machine,” he wrote. “You are evidently better equipped to test the endless variety of curved surfaces than anybody has ever been.” ([Location 1036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1036))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: The wind tunnel allowed for super rapid production-like testing. Look for ways to test ideas faster than others
- they had to keep the business going to pay for the experiments. ([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1048))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Bankroll startup ideas with job money
- Wilbur tactfully declined. Besides, he added, it seemed likely Carnegie was “too hardheaded a Scotchman to become interested in such a visionary pursuit as flying.” ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1053))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Only allow investors in that see the vision
- “Some say the boys just go camping and they make their own tents,” said one neighbor. “Others say they are trying to fly. I don’t believe they’re that foolish.” ([Location 1109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1109))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: People will doubt revolutionary goals and ideas
- Wilbur, as George Spratt once told Octave Chanute, was “always ready to oppose an idea expressed by anybody,” ready to “jump into an argument with both sleeves rolled up.” And as Wilbur himself would explain to Spratt, he believed in “a good scrap.” It brought out “new ways of looking at things,” helped “round off the corners.” ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1183))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Altogether in two months on the Outer Banks they had made nearly a thousand glides and resolved the last major control problem. ([Location 1214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1214))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Massive testing and iteration
- They knew exactly the importance of what they had accomplished. They knew they had solved the problem of flight and more. They had acquired the knowledge and the skill to fly. They could soar, they could float, they could dive and rise, circle and glide and land, all with assurance. Now they had only to build a motor. ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1219))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- To Americans throughout most of the country, the future was full of promise. A New Year’s Day editorial in the Chicago Tribune said one would have to be of “dull comprehension” not to realize things were better than they had ever been and would be “better still when new science and new methods, and new educations have done their perfect work.” ([Location 1231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1231))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Scientific and economic progress leads to optimism and hope for the future
- the Wright brothers sent out letters to manufacturers of automobile engines in seven states asking if they could supply an off-the-shelf engine light enough in weight but with sufficient power for their purposes. There was only one response, and in that case the motor was much too heavy. So again they had some original work to do and they had had no experience building engines. ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1242))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Ingenuity in the face of every obstacle. Invent what doesn’t exist
- “A thousand glides is equivalent to about four hours of steady practice,” he told the audience, and this was “far too little to give anyone a complete mastery of the art of flying. ([Location 1329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1329))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Nowhere in the talk had he said a word about the gasoline engine sitting in the back room of the bicycle shop at Dayton; or of his and Orville’s intense, often maddening work on propellers; or of what they would be up to at Kitty Hawk in only a matter of months. When the subject of motors came into discussion, he simply kept to the past tense. “As none of our experiments has been with power machines, my judgment . . . may be of little value.” ([Location 1344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1344))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Keeping works secret while they’re in development
- Have machine now within half day of completion. But when the next day they started up the motor, the magneto—a small generator utilizing magnets—failed to deliver a spark to ignite the gas and the vibrations of the misfiring engine tore loose and badly twisted the propeller shafts. With little chance of more flight tests anytime soon, George Spratt chose to go home, taking with him the damaged shafts as far as Norfolk to be shipped back to Charlie Taylor in Dayton. ([Location 1431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1431))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: On the cusp of victory, disaster strikes. Don’t let it stop you though
- By all evidence the brothers had suffered in spirit not in the least. “After a loaf of 15 days, we are down to work again,” ([Location 1447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1447))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- New propeller shafts made of larger, heavier steel tubing arrived from Charlie, only to crack during an indoor test. With no delay, Orville, the better mechanic of the two, packed his bag and on November 30 left for Dayton to see what could be done, with Wilbur remaining behind “to keep house alone,” in his words. ([Location 1450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1450))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Again disaster, but they keep chugging along
- Neither brother was ever to make critical or belittling comments about Langley. Rather, they expressed respect and gratitude for the part he had played in their efforts. Just knowing that the head of the Smithsonian, the most prominent scientific institution in America, believed in the possibility of human flight was one of the influences that led them to proceed with their work, Wilbur told Octave Chanute in a letter written some years later. ([Location 1482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1482))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- He possessed mental and moral qualities of the kind that influence history. When scientists in general considered it discreditable to work in the field of aeronautics he possessed both the discernment to discover possibilities there and the moral courage to subject himself to the ridicule of the public and the apologies of his friends.

To get to and from their remote sand dune testing ground they had made five round-trips from Dayton (counting Orville’s return home to see about stronger propeller shafts), a total of seven thousand miles by train, all to fly little more than half a mile. No matter. They had done it. ([Location 1557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LD1RWP6&location=1557))

They talked of expenses, and of stock in the enterprise. “The point is this,” Wilbur told Berg. “We do not intend you to own twenty percent of any stock. We intend to own the stock.
