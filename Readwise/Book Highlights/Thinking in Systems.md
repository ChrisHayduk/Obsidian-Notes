## Highlights
- While traveling to meetings and conferences during this time, Dana read the International Herald Tribune and during a single week found many examples of systems in need of better management or complete redesign. She found them in the newspaper because they are all around us every day. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=142))

- Once you start to see the events of the day as parts of trends, and those trends as symptoms of underlying system structure, you will be able to consider new ways to manage and new ways to live in a world of complex systems.

- Managers are not confronted with problems that are independent of each other, but with dynamic situations that consist of complex systems of changing problems that interact with each other. I call such situations messes.… Managers do not solve problems, they manage messes. ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=157))

- Once we see the relationship between structure and behavior, we can begin to understand how systems work, what makes them produce poor results, and how to shift them into better behavior patterns. ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=171))

- A system is a set of things—people, cells, molecules, or whatever—interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behavior over time. The system may be buffeted, constricted, triggered, or driven by outside forces. But the system’s response to these forces is characteristic of itself, and that response is seldom simple in the real world. ([Location 175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=175))

    - Note: Emergent behavior from complex system
- The system, to a large extent, causes its own behavior! ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=179))

- Think for a moment about the implications of that idea: Political leaders don’t cause recessions or economic booms. Ups and downs are inherent in the structure of the market economy. Competitors rarely cause a company to lose market share. They may be there to scoop up the advantage, but the losing company creates its losses at least in part through its own business policies. The oil-exporting nations are not solely responsible for oil-price rises. Their actions alone could not trigger global price rises and economic chaos if the oil consumption, pricing, and investment policies of the oil-importing nations had not built economies that are vulnerable to supply interruptions. The flu virus does not attack you; you set up the conditions for it to flourish within you. Drug addiction is not the failing of an individual and no one person, no matter how tough, no matter how loving, can cure a drug addict—not even the addict. It is only through understanding addiction as part of a larger set of influences and societal issues that one can begin to address it.

- Ever since the Industrial Revolution, Western society has benefited from science, logic, and reductionism over intuition and holism. ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=211))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Shift from right brain to left brain
- Hunger, poverty, environmental degradation, economic instability, unemployment, chronic disease, drug addiction, and war, for example, persist in spite of the analytical ability and technical brilliance that have been directed toward eradicating them. No one deliberately creates those problems, no one wants them to persist, but they persist nonetheless. That is because they are intrinsically systems problems—undesirable behaviors characteristic of the system structures that produce them. They will yield only as we reclaim our intuition, stop casting blame, see the system as the source of its own problems, and find the courage and wisdom to restructure it.

    - Note: Causation not always lineae cause and effect. Dynamic, opposing forces can create new out of the friction
- I have made liberal use of diagrams and time graphs in this book because there is a problem in discussing systems only with words. Words and sentences must, by necessity, come only one at a time in linear, logical order. Systems happen all at once. They are connected not just in one direction, but in many directions simultaneously. To discuss them properly, it is necessary somehow to use a language that shares some of the same properties as the phenomena under discussion. ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=228))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Language supports linear, rational thought. Nonlinear and nonrational thought is bettee conveyed through less linear mediums such as images. Poetry or the subtext of literature are the best approximations using language
- why a system might suddenly, and without warning, jump into a kind of behavior you’ve never seen before. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=242))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Phase change in chaotic system
- Systems thinkers call these common structures that produce characteristic behaviors “archetypes.” ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=249))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Jungian archetypes categorize emergent behavior from human systems. Complex analysis applied to psychology
- I don’t think the systems way of seeing is better than the reductionist way of thinking. I think it’s complementary, and therefore revealing. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=260))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Right and left brain modes together
- The systems-thinking lens allows us to reclaim our intuition about whole systems and hone our abilities to understand parts, see interconnections, ask “what-if” questions about possible future behaviors, and be creative and courageous about system redesign. ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=265))

- The behavior of a system cannot be known just by knowing the elements of which the system is made. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=282))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- A system* is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something. If you look at that definition closely for a minute, you can see that a system must consist of three kinds of things: elements, interconnections, and a function or purpose. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=295))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Systems can be embedded in systems, which are embedded in yet other systems. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=306))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Is there anything that is not a system? Yes—a conglomeration without any particular interconnections or function. Sand scattered on a road by happenstance is not, itself, a system. You can add sand or take away sand and you still have just sand on the road. Arbitrarily add or take away football players, or pieces of your digestive system, and you quickly no longer have the same system. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=307))

- A system is more than the sum of its parts. It may exhibit adaptive, dynamic, goal-seeking, self-preserving, and sometimes evolutionary behavior. ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=313))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: The interactions in a system create a new kind of thing that is not itself part of a system
- Systems can change, adapt, respond to events, seek goals, mend injuries, and attend to their own survival in lifelike ways, although they may contain or consist of nonliving things. Systems can be self-organizing, and often are self-repairing over at least some range of disruptions. They are resilient, and many of them are evolutionary. Out of one system other completely new, never-before-imagined systems can arise. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=316))

- Elements do not have to be physical things. Intangibles are also elements of a system. ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=327))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Once you start listing the elements of a system, there is almost no end to the process. You can divide elements into sub-elements and then sub-sub-elements. Pretty soon you lose sight of the system. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=329))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- How to know whether you are looking at a system or just a bunch of stuff: A) Can you identify parts? … and B) Do the parts affect each other? … and C) Do the parts together produce an effect that is different from the effect of each part on its own? … and perhaps D) Does the effect, the behavior over time, persist in a variety of circumstances? ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=332))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- it’s a good idea to stop dissecting out elements and to start looking for the interconnections, the relationships that hold the elements together. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=339))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- It’s easier to learn about a system’s elements than about its interconnections. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=348))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Many of the interconnections in systems operate through the flow of information. Information holds systems together and plays a great role in determining how they operate. ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=352))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Biologically this is accomplished through signaling pathways
- A system’s function or purpose is not necessarily spoken, written, or expressed explicitly, except through the operation of the system. The best way to deduce the system’s purpose is to watch for a while to see how the system behaves. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=362))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Purposes are deduced from behavior, not from rhetoric or stated goals. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=367))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- An important function of almost every system is to ensure its own perpetuation. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=374))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: How would a system look that doesn't perpetuate its existence? Could a system that doesn't explicitly optimize for continued existence persist?
- one of the most frustrating aspects of systems is that the purposes of subunits may add up to an overall behavior that no one wants. ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=376))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Systems can be nested within systems. Therefore, there can be purposes within purposes. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=385))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Keeping sub-purposes and overall system purposes in harmony is an essential function of successful systems. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=389))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- You can understand the relative importance of a system’s elements, interconnections, and purposes by imagining them changed one by one. ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=391))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Mental simulation
- Changing elements usually has the least effect on the system. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=392))

- A tree changes its cells constantly, its leaves every year or so, but it is still essentially the same tree. Your body replaces most of its cells every few weeks, but it goes on being your body. The university has a constant flow of students and a slower flow of professors and administrators, but it is still a university. In fact it is still the same university, distinct in subtle ways from others, just as General Motors and the U.S. Congress somehow maintain their identities even though all their members change. A system generally goes on being itself, changing only slowly if at all, even with complete substitutions of its elements—as long as its interconnections and purposes remain intact. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=393))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Ship of theseus paradox. The system is the invariant, the elements change
- The least obvious part of the system, its function or purpose, is often the most crucial determinant of the system’s behavior. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=399))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- If the interconnections change, the system may be greatly altered. It may even become unrecognizable, ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=401))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- A change in purpose changes a system profoundly, even if every element and interconnection remains the same. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=410))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- the least obvious part of the system, its function or purpose, is often the most crucial determinant of the system’s behavior. Interconnections are also critically important. Changing relationships usually changes system behavior. The elements, the parts of systems we are most likely to notice, are often (not always) least important in defining the unique characteristics of the system—unless changing an element also results in changing relationships or purpose. ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=412))

- Changing just one leader at the top—from a Brezhnev to a Gorbachev, or from a Carter to a Reagan—may or may not turn an entire nation in a new direction, though its land, factories, and hundreds of millions of people remain exactly the same. A leader can make that land and those factories and people play a different game with new rules, or can direct the play toward a new purpose. ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=415))

- A stock is the foundation of any system. Stocks are the elements of the system that you can see, feel, count, or measure at any given time. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=426))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- A stock is the memory of the history of changing flows within the system. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=431))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Stocks change over time through the actions of a flow. Flows are filling and draining, births and deaths, purchases and sales, growth and decay, deposits and withdrawals, successes and failures. A stock, then, is the present memory of the history of changing flows within the system. ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=432))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- If you understand the dynamics of stocks and flows—their behavior over time—you understand a good deal about the behavior of complex systems. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=454))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Systems thinkers use graphs of system behavior to understand trends over time, rather than focusing attention on individual events. We also use behavior-over-time graphs to learn whether the system is approaching a goal or a limit, and if so, how quickly. The variable on the graph may be a stock or a flow. The pattern—the shape of the variable line—is important, as are the points at which that line changes shape or direction. The precise numbers on the axes are often less important. The horizontal axis of time allows you to ask questions about what came before, and what might happen next. It can help you focus on the time horizon appropriate to the question or problem you are investigating. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=465))

- a state of dynamic equilibrium—its level does not change, although water is continuously flowing through it. ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=475))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: A constant state created by dynamic opposing forces. Yin yang
- you can deduce several important principles that extend to more complicated systems: As long as the sum of all inflows exceeds the sum of all outflows, the level of the stock will rise. As long as the sum of all outflows exceeds the sum of all inflows, the level of the stock will fall. If the sum of all outflows equals the sum of all inflows, the stock level will not change; it will be held in dynamic equilibrium at whatever level it happened to be when the two sets of flows became equal. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=484))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The human mind seems to focus more easily on stocks than on flows. On top of that, when we do focus on flows, we tend to focus on inflows more easily than on outflows. Therefore, we sometimes miss seeing that we can fill a bathtub not only by increasing the inflow rate, but also by decreasing the outflow rate. ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=489))

    - Note: Lowering costs vs increasing revenues
- A breakthrough in energy efficiency is equivalent, in its effect on the stock of available oil, to the discovery of a new oil field—although different people profit from it. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=493))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- A stock can be increased by decreasing its outflow rate as well as by increasing its inflow rate. There’s more than one way to fill a bathtub! ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=495))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The wealth of a nation can be boosted by investment to build up a larger stock of factories and machines. It also can be boosted, often more cheaply, by decreasing the rate at which factories and machines wear out, break down, or are discarded. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=498))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- A stock takes time to change, because flows take time to flow. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=503))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Stocks generally change slowly, even when the flows into or out of them change suddenly. Therefore, stocks act as delays or buffers or shock absorbers in systems. ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=506))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Changes in stocks set the pace of the dynamics of systems. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=514))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The time lags that come from slowly changing stocks can cause problems in systems, but they also can be sources of stability. ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=517))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- If you have a sense of the rates of change of stocks, you don’t expect things to happen faster than they can happen. You don’t give up too soon. You can use the opportunities presented by a system’s momentum to guide it toward a good outcome—much as a judo expert uses the momentum of an opponent to achieve his or her own goals. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=521))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The presence of stocks allows inflows and outflows to be independent of each other and temporarily out of balance with each other. ([Location 524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=524))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Stocks allow inflows and outflows to be decoupled and to be independent and temporarily out of balance with each other. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=526))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Human beings have invented hundreds of stock-maintaining mechanisms to make inflows and outflows independent and stable. Reservoirs enable residents and farmers downriver to live without constantly adjusting their lives and work to a river’s varying flow, especially its droughts and floods. Banks enable you temporarily to earn money at a rate different from how you spend. Inventories of products along a chain from distributors to wholesalers to retailers allow production to proceed smoothly although customer demand varies, and allow customer demand to be filled even though production rates vary. ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=531))

- Most individual and institutional decisions are designed to regulate the levels in stocks. ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=535))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Systems thinkers see the world as a collection of stocks along with the mechanisms for regulating the levels in the stocks by manipulating flows. That means system thinkers see the world as a collection of “feedback processes.” ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=543))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Systems of information-feedback control are fundamental to all life and human endeavor, from the slow pace of biological evolution to the launching of the latest space satellite.… Everything we do as individuals, as an industry, or as a society is done in the context of an information-feedback system. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=547))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Dynamic interacting behaviors in systems produce emergent changes in stocks and flows. A small push in a direction can compound into greater change
- if you see a behavior that persists over time, there is likely a mechanism creating that consistent behavior. That mechanism operates through a feedback loop. It is the consistent behavior pattern over a long period of time that is the first hint of the existence of a feedback loop. ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=552))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- A feedback loop is formed when changes in a stock affect the flows into or out of that same stock. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=554))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Personal level: learning leads to more background knowledge which an easier time understanding new material which leads to faster learning
- Feedback loops can cause stocks to maintain their level within a range or grow or decline. In any case, the flows into or out of the stock are adjusted because of changes in the size of the stock itself. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=565))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: The stock itself is information, and that information flows to inflows and outflows to regulate them. Think testosterone production being down regulated when exogenous testosterone is supplemented
- A feedback loop is a closed chain of causal connections from a stock, through a set of decisions or rules or physical laws or actions that are dependent on the level of the stock, and back again through a flow to change the stock. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=576))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- One common kind of feedback loop stabilizes the stock level, as in the checking-account example. The stock level may not remain completely fixed, but it does stay within an acceptable range. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=579))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Balancing feedback loops are goal-seeking or stability-seeking. ([Location 603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=603))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- A balancing feedback loop opposes whatever direction of change is imposed on the system. If you push a stock too far up, a balancing loop will try to pull it back down. If you shove it too far down, a balancing loop will try to bring it back up. ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=604))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- the feedback loop brings it toward the goal. The change is faster at first, and then slower, as the discrepancy between the stock and the goal decreases. ([Location 618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=618))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Balancing feedback loops are equilibrating or goal-seeking structures in systems and are both sources of stability and sources of resistance to change. ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=626))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Feedbacks—the interconnections, the information part of the system—can fail for many reasons. Information can arrive too late or at the wrong place. It can be unclear or incomplete or hard to interpret. The action it triggers may be too weak or delayed or resource-constrained or simply ineffective. The goal of the feedback loop may never be reached by the actual stock. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=629))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The second kind of feedback loop is amplifying, reinforcing, self-multiplying, snowballing—a vicious or virtuous circle that can cause healthy growth or runaway destruction. It is called a reinforcing feedback loop, and will be noted with an R in the diagrams. It generates more input to a stock the more that is already there (and less input the less that is already there). A reinforcing feedback loop enhances whatever direction of change is imposed on it. ([Location 641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=641))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Can seem like circular logic when thinking in a linear paradigm but it's not. The trend and the stock are both each other's cause and bear each other's effect
- Reinforcing loops are found wherever a system element has the ability to reproduce itself or to grow as a constant fraction of itself. Those elements include populations and economies. ([Location 654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=654))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Reinforcing feedback loops are self-enhancing, leading to exponential growth or to runaway collapses over time. They are found whenever a stock has the capacity to reinforce or reproduce itself. ([Location 668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=668))

- the more machines and factories (collectively called “capital”) you have, the more goods and services (“output”) you can produce. The more output you can produce, the more you can invest in new machines and factories. The more you make, the more capacity you have to make even more. This reinforcing feedback loop is the central engine of growth in an economy. ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=670))

    - Note: Access to capital creates self reinforcing growth
- Because we bump into reinforcing loops so often, it is handy to know this shortcut: The time it takes for an exponentially growing stock to double in size, the “doubling time,” equals approximately 70 divided by the growth rate (expressed as a percentage). Example: If you put $100 in the bank at 7% interest per year, you will double your money in 10 years (70 ÷ 7 = 10). If you get only 5% interest, your money will take 14 years to double.

- There’s an important general principle here, and also one specific to the thermostat structure. First the general one: The information delivered by a feedback loop can only affect future behavior; it can’t deliver the information, and so can’t have an impact fast enough to correct behavior that drove the current feedback. A person in the system who makes a decision based on the feedback can’t change the behavior of the system that drove the current feedback; the decisions he or she makes will affect only future behavior.

- Complex systems can evolve from simple systems only if there are stable intermediate forms. The resulting complex forms will naturally be hierarchic. That may explain why hierarchies are so common in the systems nature presents to us. Among all possible complex forms, hierarchies are the only ones that have had the time to evolve.5 ([Location 1411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=1411))

    - Note: Aggregating small stable systems into a larger system is more likely to work than building a big system all at once, leading to hierarchies
- Hierarchies are brilliant systems inventions, not only because they give a system stability and resilience, but also because they reduce the amount of information that any part of the system has to keep track of.

- If these differential information links within and between each level of the hierarchy are designed right, feedback delays are minimized. No level is overwhelmed with information.

    - Note: Hierarchies allow us to analyze subsystems individually which is useful. But we must not forget that the subsystems don't actually act independently (the map is not the territory). They operate in a complex network of interactions
- If you have a liver disease, for example, a doctor usually can treat it without paying much attention to your heart or your tonsils (to stay on the same hierarchical level) or your personality (to move up a level or two) or the DNA in the nuclei of the liver cells (to move down several levels). There are just enough exceptions to that rule, however, to reinforce the necessity of stepping back to consider the whole hierarchy. Maybe your job exposes you to a chemical that is damaging your liver. Maybe the disease originates in a malfunction of the DNA.

- The original purpose of a hierarchy is always to help its originating subsystems do their jobs better. This is something, unfortunately, that both the higher and the lower levels of a greatly articulated hierarchy easily can forget.

    - Note: Hierarchies start because they're in the best interests of the subunits comprising them. The systems can then evolve to the point where that isn't the case
- When a subsystem’s goals dominate at the expense of the total system’s goals, the resulting behavior is called suboptimization. Just as damaging as suboptimization, of course, is the problem of too much central control. ([Location 1445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=1445))

    - Note: Balance between chaos and order

- three truths: Everything we think we know about the world is a model. Every word and every language is a model. All maps and statistics, books and databases, equations and computer programs are models. So are the ways I picture the world in my head—my mental models. None of these is or ever will be the real world. Our models usually have a strong congruence with the world. That is why we are such a successful species in the biosphere. Especially complex and sophisticated are the mental models we develop from direct, intimate experience of nature, people, and organizations immediately around us. However, and conversely, our models fall far short of representing the world fully. That is why we make mistakes and why we are regularly surprised. In our heads, we can keep track of only a few variables at one time. We often draw illogical conclusions from accurate assumptions, or logical conclusions from inaccurate assumptions. Most of us, for instance, are surprised by the amount of growth an exponential process can generate. Few of us can intuit how to damp oscillations in a complex system.

- Most economic analysis goes one level deeper, to behavior over time. Econometric models strive to find the statistical links among past trends in income, savings, investment, government spending, interest rates, output, or whatever, often in complicated equations. These behavior-based models are more useful than event-based ones, but they still have fundamental problems. First, they typically overemphasize system flows and underemphasize stocks. Economists follow the behavior of flows, because that’s where the interesting variations and most rapid changes in systems show up. Economic news reports on the national production (flow) of goods and services, the GNP, rather than the total physical capital (stock) of the nation’s factories and farms and businesses that produce those goods and services. But without seeing how stocks affect their related flows through feedback processes, one cannot understand the dynamics of economic systems or the reasons for their behavior. Second, and more seriously, in trying to find statistical links that relate flows to each other, econometricians are searching for something that does not exist. There’s no reason to expect any flow to bear a stable relationship to any other flow. Flows go up and down, on and off, in all sorts of combinations, in response to stocks, not to other flows. ([Location 1536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=1536))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: By ignoring stocks, economics ignores the triggers for feedback loops to initiate. Example to explore: housing stock, stock of lendable, and the flows governed by interest rates, income levels, new building rates, house demolition rates, etc all determine house prices. But stock of homes and stock of lendable capital are key
- behavior-based econometric models are pretty good at predicting the near-term performance of the economy, quite bad at predicting the longer-term performance, and terrible at telling one how to improve the performance of the economy.

- the world often surprises our linear-thinking minds. If we’ve learned that a small push produces a small response, we think that twice as big a push will produce twice as big a response.

- There are layers of limits around every growing plant, child, epidemic, new product, technological advance, company, city, economy, and population. Insight comes not only from recognizing which factor is limiting, but from seeing that growth itself depletes or enhances limits and therefore changes what is limiting. The interplay between a growing plant and the soil, a growing company and its market, a growing economy and its resource base, is dynamic. Whenever one factor ceases to be limiting, growth occurs, and the growth itself changes the relative scarcity of factors until another becomes limiting. To shift attention from the abundant factors to the next potential limiting factor is to gain real understanding of, and control over, the growth process.

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Changing the length of a delay may utterly change behavior. Delays are often sensitive leverage points for policy, if they can be made shorter or longer. You can see why that is. If a decision point in a system (or a person working in that part of the system) is responding to delayed information, or responding with a delay, the decisions will be off target. Actions will be too much or too little to achieve the decision maker’s goals. On the other hand, if action is taken too fast, it may nervously amplify short-term variation and create unnecessary instability. Delays determine how fast systems can react, how accurately they hit their targets, and how timely is the information passed around a system. Overshoots, oscillations, and collapses are always caused by delays. ([Location 1815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=1815))

We discount the future at rates that make no economic or ecological sense. We don’t give all incoming signals their appropriate weights. We don’t let in at all news we don’t like, or information that doesn’t fit our mental models.

If you wield enough power and can keep wielding it, the power approach can work, at the cost of monumental resentment and the possibility of explosive consequences if the power is ever let up.

Let the resources and energy spent on both enforcing and resisting be used for more constructive purposes. ([Location 1993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=1993))

- The most effective way of dealing with policy resistance is to find a way of aligning the various goals of the subsystems, usually by providing an overarching goal that allows all actors to break out of their bounded rationality. If everyone can work harmoniously toward the same outcome (if all feedback loops are serving the same goal), the results can be amazing. The most familiar examples of this harmonization of goals are mobilizations of economies during wartime, or recovery after war or natural disaster.

- THE TRAP: POLICY RESISTANCE When various actors try to pull a system stock toward various goals, the result can be policy resistance. Any new policy, especially if it’s effective, just pulls the stock farther from the goals of other actors and produces additional resistance, with a result that no one likes, but that everyone expends considerable effort in maintaining. THE WAY OUT Let go. Bring in all the actors and use the energy formerly expended on resistance to seek out mutually satisfactory ways for all goals to be realized—or redefinitions of larger and more important goals that everyone can pull toward together.

- In any commons system there is, first of all, a resource that is commonly shared (the pasture). For the system to be subject to tragedy, the resource must be not only limited, but erodable when overused. That is, beyond some threshold, the less resource there is, the less it is able to regenerate itself, or the more likely it is to be destroyed.

    - Note: Negative externalities never reach producer or do on such a long timescale that they can be safely ignored, eg. pollution and climate affecting activities
- Tragedy can lurk not only in the use of common resources, but also in the use of common sinks, shared places where pollution can be dumped. A family, company, or nation can reduce its costs, increase its profits, or grow faster if it can get the entire community to absorb or handle its wastes. It reaps a large gain, while itself having to live with only a fraction of its own pollution (or none, if it can dump downstream or downwind). There is no rational reason why a polluter should desist. ([Location 2072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=2072))

- There are three ways to avoid the tragedy of the commons. Educate and exhort. Help people to see the consequences of unrestrained use of the commons. Appeal to their morality. Persuade them to be temperate. Threaten transgressors with social disapproval or eternal hellfire. Privatize the commons. Divide it up, so that each person reaps the consequences of his or her own actions. If some people lack the self-control to stay below the carrying capacity of their own private resource, those people will harm only themselves and not others. Regulate the commons. Garrett Hardin calls this option, bluntly, “mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon.” Regulation can take many forms, from outright bans on certain behaviors to quotas, permits, taxes, incentives. To be effective, regulation must be enforced by policing and penalties. ([Location 2080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=2080))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The first of these solutions, exhortation, tries to keep use of the commons low enough through moral pressure that the resource is not threatened. The second, privatization, makes a direct feedback link from the condition of the resource to those who use it, by making sure that gains and losses fall on the same decision maker. The owner still may abuse the resource, but now it takes ignorance or irrationality to do so. The third solution, regulation, makes an indirect feedback link from the condition of the resource through regulators to users. For this feedback to work, the regulators must have the expertise to monitor and interpret correctly the condition of the commons, they must have effective means of deterrence, and they must have the good of the whole community at heart.

- THE TRAP: TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS When there is a commonly shared resource, every user benefits directly from its use, but shares the costs of its abuse with everyone else. Therefore, there is very weak feedback from the condition of the resource to the decisions of the resource users. The consequence is overuse of the resource, eroding it until it becomes unavailable to anyone. THE WAY OUT Educate and exhort the users, so they understand the consequences of abusing the resource. And also restore or strengthen the missing feedback link, either by privatizing the resource so each user feels the direct consequences of its abuse or (since many resources cannot be privatized) by regulating the access of all users to the resource.

- Some systems not only resist policy and stay in a normal bad state, they keep getting worse. One name for this archetype is “drift to low performance.” ([Location 2137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=2137))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- The actor in this feedback loop (British government, business, hospital, fat person, school administrator, jogger) has, as usual, a performance goal or desired system state that is compared to the actual state. If there is a discrepancy, action is taken. So far, that is an ordinary balancing feedback loop that should keep performance at the desired level. But in this system, there is a distinction between the actual system state and the perceived state. The actor tends to believe bad news more than good news. As actual performance varies, the best results are dismissed as aberrations, the worst results stay in the memory. The actor thinks things are worse than they really are. And to complete this tragic archetype, the desired state of the system is influenced by the perceived state. Standards aren’t absolute. When perceived performance slips, the goal is allowed to slip. “Well, that’s about all you can expect.” “Well, we’re not doing much worse than we were last year.” “Well, look around, everybody else is having trouble too.” The balancing feedback loop that should keep the system state at an acceptable level is overwhelmed by a reinforcing feedback loop heading downhill. The lower the perceived system state, the lower the desired state. The lower the desired state, the less discrepancy, and the less corrective action is taken. The less corrective action, the lower the system state. If this loop is allowed to run unchecked, it can lead to a continuous degradation in the system’s performance.

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: PAY ATTENTION TO WINS AND GOOD FEEDBACK. DO NOT ALLOW YOURSELF TO ERODE GOALS. Once you start prioritizing bad feedback and allowing your goals to erode, the whole system will collapse
- Drift to low performance is a gradual process. If the system state plunged quickly, there would be an agitated corrective process. But if it drifts down slowly enough to erase the memory of (or belief in) how much better things used to be, everyone is lulled into lower and lower expectations, lower effort, lower performance.

    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- There are two antidotes to eroding goals. One is to keep standards absolute, regardless of performance. Another is to make goals sensitive to the best performances of the past, instead of the worst. If perceived performance has an upbeat bias instead of a downbeat one, if one takes the best results as a standard, and the worst results only as a temporary setback, then the same system structure can pull the system up to better and better performance. The reinforcing loop going downward, which said “the worse things get, the worse I’m going to let them get,” becomes a reinforcing loop going upward: “The better things get, the harder I’m going to work to make them even better.” ([Location 2159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=2159))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Make goals invariant in the face of bad performance. Also, imagine performance as a time series with peaks and valleys. Imagine a line connecting the peaks and a line connecting the valleys (think bitcoin boom and bust chart). ALWAYS focus on the peaks line. NEVER focus on the valleys line. Valleys are isolated events to learn from. Peaks are the trend to give you optimism and motivation
- THE TRAP: DRIFT TO LOW PERFORMANCE Allowing performance standards to be influenced by past performance, especially if there is a negative bias in perceiving past performance, sets up a reinforcing feedback loop of eroding goals that sets a system drifting toward low performance. THE WAY OUT Keep performance standards absolute. Even better, let standards be enhanced by the best actual performances instead of being discouraged by the worst. Use the same structure to set up a drift toward high performance! ([Location 2165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=2165))

- Like many of the other system traps, escalation is not necessarily a bad thing. If the competition is about some desirable goal, like a more efficient computer or a cure for AIDS, it can hasten the whole system toward the goal. But when it is escalating hostility, weaponry, noise, or irritation, this is an insidious trap indeed. The most common and awful examples are arms races and those places on earth where implacable enemies live constantly on the edge of self-reinforcing violence.

- THE TRAP: ESCALATION When the state of one stock is determined by trying to surpass the state of another stock—and vice versa—then there is a reinforcing feedback loop carrying the system into an arms race, a wealth race, a smear campaign, escalating loudness, escalating violence. The escalation is exponential and can lead to extremes surprisingly quickly. If nothing is done, the spiral will be stopped by someone’s collapse—because exponential growth cannot go on forever. THE WAY OUT The best way out of this trap is to avoid getting in it. If caught in an escalating system, one can refuse to compete (unilaterally disarm), thereby interrupting the reinforcing loop. Or one can negotiate a new system with balancing loops to control the escalation. ([Location 2217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=2217))

- Using accumulated wealth, privilege, special access, or inside information to create more wealth, privilege, access or information are examples of the archetype called “success to the successful.” This system trap is found whenever the winners of a competition receive, as part of the reward, the means to compete even more effectively in the future. That’s a reinforcing feedback loop, which rapidly divides a system into winners who go on winning, and losers who go on losing.

- Success to the successful is a well-known concept in the field of ecology, where it is called “the competitive exclusion principle.” This principle says that two different species cannot live in exactly the same ecological niche, competing for exactly the same resources. Because the two species are different, one will necessarily reproduce faster, or be able to use the resource more efficiently than the other. It will win a larger share of the resource, which will give it the ability to multiply more and keep winning. It will not only dominate the niche, it will drive the losing competitor to extinction. That will happen not by direct confrontation usually, but by appropriating all the resource, leaving none for the weaker competitor.

Whether it is a substance that dulls one’s perception or a policy that hides the underlying trouble, the drug of choice interferes with the actions that could solve the real problem. If the intervention designed to correct the problem causes the self-maintaining capacity of the original system to atrophy or erode, then a destructive reinforcing feedback loop is set in motion. The system deteriorates; more and more of the solution is then required. The system will become more and more dependent on the intervention and less and less able to maintain its own desired state. THE WAY OUT Again, the best way out of this trap is to avoid getting in. Beware of symptom-relieving or signal-denying policies or practices that don’t really address the problem.

- one of the most powerful ways to influence the behavior of a system is through its purpose or goal.

- If the desired system state is good education, measuring that goal by the amount of money spent per student will ensure money spent per student. If the quality of education is measured by performance on standardized tests, the system will produce performance on standardized tests.

- The GNP lumps together goods and bads. (If there are more car accidents and medical bills and repair bills, the GNP goes up.) It counts only marketed goods and services. (If all parents hired people to bring up their children, the GNP would go up.) It does not reflect distributional equity. (An expensive second home for a rich family makes the GNP go up more than an inexpensive basic home for a poor family.) It measures effort rather than achievement, gross production and consumption rather than efficiency. New light bulbs that give the same light with one-eighth the electricity and that last ten times as long make the GNP go down. GNP is a measure of throughput—flows of stuff made and purchased in a year—rather than capital stocks, the houses and cars and computers and stereos that are the source of real wealth and real pleasure. It could be argued that the best society would be one in which capital stocks can be maintained and used with the lowest possible throughput, rather than the highest.

- If I could, I would add an eleventh commandment to the first ten: Thou shalt not distort, delay, or withhold information. You can drive a system crazy by muddying its information streams. You can make a system work better with surprising ease if you can give it more timely, more accurate, more complete information.

- Our information streams are composed primarily of language. Our mental models are mostly verbal. Honoring information means above all avoiding language pollution—making the cleanest possible use we can of language. Second, it means expanding our language so we can talk about complexity.

- My impression is that we have seen, for perhaps a hundred and fifty years, a gradual increase in language that is either meaningless or destructive of meaning. And I believe that this increasing unreliability of language parallels the increasing disintegration, over the same period, of persons and communities.… ([Location 3062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=3062))

- The first step in respecting language is keeping it as concrete, meaningful, and truthful as possible—part of the job of keeping information streams clear. The second step is to enlarge language to make it consistent with our enlarged understanding of systems. ([Location 3070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=3070))

- Our culture, obsessed with numbers, has given us the idea that what we can measure is more important than what we can’t measure. Think about that for a minute.

- a dynamic, self-adjusting feedback system cannot be governed by a static, unbending policy. It’s easier, more effective, and usually much cheaper to design policies that change depending on the state of the system. Especially where there are great uncertainties, the best policies not only contain feedback loops, but meta-feedback loops—loops that alter, correct, and expand loops. These are policies that design learning into the management process. ([Location 3114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=3114))

- Error-embracing is the condition for learning. It means seeking and using—and sharing—information about what went wrong with what you expected or hoped would go right. Both error embracing and living with high levels of uncertainty emphasize our personal as well as societal vulnerability. Typically we hide our vulnerabilities from ourselves as well as from others. But … to be the kind of person who truly accepts his responsibility … requires knowledge of and access to self far beyond that possessed by most people in this society.9 ([Location 3182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=3182))

Another part of us recognizes instinctively that nature designs in fractals, with intriguing detail on every scale from the microscopic to the macroscopic. That part of us makes Gothic cathedrals and Persian carpets, symphonies and novels, Mardi Gras costumes and artificial intelligence programs, all with embellishments almost as complex as the ones we find in the world around us.

- Living successfully in a world of complex systems means expanding not only time horizons and thought horizons; above all, it means expanding the horizons of caring. There are moral reasons for doing that, of course. And if moral arguments are not sufficient, then systems thinking provides the practical reasons to back up the moral ones. The real system is interconnected. No part of the human race is separate either from other human beings or from the global ecosystem. It will not be possible in this integrated world for your heart to succeed if your lungs fail, or for your company to succeed if your workers fail, or for the rich in Los Angeles to succeed if the poor in Los Angeles fail, or for Europe to succeed if Africa fails, or for the global economy to succeed if the global environment fails.

- Thus though man has never before been so complacent about what he has, or so confident of his ability to do whatever he sets his mind upon, it is at the same time true that he never before accepted so low an estimate of what he is. That same scientific method which enabled him to create his wealth and to unleash the power he wields has, he believes, enabled biology and psychology to explain him away—or at least to explain away whatever used to seem unique or even in any way mysterious.… Truly he is, for all his wealth and power, poor in spirit.12 ([Location 3250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=3250))
