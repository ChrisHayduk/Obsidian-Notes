- Summary: LLMs (large language models) are not just chatbots, but rather the kernel process of a new Operating System. They can handle input and output across different modalities, serve as code interpreters, provide browser and internet access, and store and retrieve embeddings and files. LLMs also have similarities to operating systems in terms of different versions and platforms. Looking at LLMs as chatbots is akin to viewing early computers as calculators, as they represent a new computing paradigm that is still in its early stages.

## Highlights
- With many ![ðŸ§©](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f9e9.svg "Puzzle piece") dropping recently, a more complete picture is emerging of LLMs not as a chatbot, but the kernel process of a new Operating System. E.g. today it orchestrates: - Input & Output across modalities (text, audio, vision) - Code interpreter, ability to write & run programs - Browser / internet access - Embeddings database for files and internal memory storage & retrieval A lot of computing concepts carry over. Currently we have single-threaded execution running at ~10Hz (tok/s) and enjoy looking at the assembly-level execution traces stream by. Concepts from computer security carry over, with attacks, defenses and emerging vulnerabilities. I also like the nearest neighbor analogy of "Operating System" because the industry is starting to shape up similar: Windows, OS X, and Linux <-> GPT, PaLM, Claude, and Llama/Mistral(?:)). An OS comes with default apps but has an app store. Most apps can be adapted to multiple platforms. TLDR looking at LLMs as chatbots is the same as looking at early computers as calculators. We're seeing an emergence of a whole new computing paradigm, and it is very early. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqkxeq50490gx5w727s00rh9))
