# Notes
## RNA (Wikipedia)
- RNA is a molecule that is essential for most biological functions. It comes in two broad types:
	- Non-coding RNA: performs functions itself
	- Messenger RNA (mRNA): provides a template for the production of proteins
- Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules deliver amino acids to the ribosome, where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) then links amino acids together to form coded proteins
- The chemical structure of RNA is very similar to that of DNA, but differs in three primary ways:
	- Unlike double-stranded DNA, RNA is usually a single-stranded molecule in many of its biological roles and consists of much shorter chains of nucleotides. However, [double-stranded RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA#Double-stranded_RNA) (dsRNA) can form and (moreover) a single RNA molecule can, by complementary base pairing, form intrastrand double helixes, as in [tRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_RNA "Transfer RNA").
	- While the sugar-phosphate "backbone" of DNA contains _[deoxyribose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose "Deoxyribose")_, RNA contains _[ribose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribose "Ribose")_ instead. Ribose has a [hydroxyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxy_group "Hydroxy group") group attached to the pentose ring in the [2'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_nomenclature "Nucleic acid nomenclature") position, whereas deoxyribose does not. The hydroxyl groups in the ribose backbone make RNA more chemically [labile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lability "Lability") (i.e. more easily changeable or reactive) than DNA by lowering the [activation energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_energy "Activation energy") of [hydrolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis "Hydrolysis").
	- The complementary base to [adenine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine "Adenine") in DNA is [thymine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine "Thymine"), whereas in RNA, it is [uracil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil "Uracil"), which is an [unmethylated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation "Methylation") form of thymine.
- Like DNA, most biologically active RNAs, including [mRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA "MRNA"), [tRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRNA "TRNA"), [rRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RRNA "RRNA"), [snRNAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SnRNA "SnRNA"), and other [non-coding RNAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_RNA "Non-coding RNA"), contain self-complementary sequences that allow parts of the RNA to fold and pair with itself to form double helices. Analysis of these RNAs has revealed that they are highly structured. Unlike DNA, their structures do not consist of long double helices, but rather collections of short helices packed together into structures akin to proteins.
- The functional form of single-stranded RNA molecules, just like proteins, frequently requires a specific [tertiary structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_Tertiary_Structure "RNA Tertiary Structure"). The scaffold for this structure is provided by [secondary structural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure "Secondary structure") elements that are hydrogen bonds within the molecule.
- About 97% of transcriptional output (i.e. DNA to RNA transcription) results in non-protein-coding RNA in eukaryotes. These are all types of RNA *aside from* mRNA (which carries information from DNA to the ribosome for protein production)
## RNA Therapeutics (Wikipedia)
- **The main types of RNA therapeutics are based on**
	- **Messenger RNA (mRNA)**
		- Responsible for bringing genetic data (i.e. one codon of 3 nucleotides) to ribosomes to produce amino acids. Comes as a result of the transcription step. The administration of a nucleoside-modified mRNA sequence can cause a cell to make a protein, which in turn could directly treat a disease or could function as a vaccine
		- mRNA-based therapy is the only type which is based on triggering synthesis of proteins within cells, making it particularly useful in vaccine development
		- DNA therapeutics needs access to the nucleus to be transcribed into RNA, and its functionality depends on nuclear envelope breakdown during cell division. However, mRNA therapeutics do not need to enter into the nucleus to be functional since it will be translated immediately once it has reached to the cytoplasm. Moreover, unlike plasmids and viral vectors, mRNAs do not integrate into the genome and therefore do not have the risk of insertional mutagenesis, making them suitable for use in cancer vaccines, tumor immunotherapy and infectious disease prevention
		- **Mechanisms:** In vitro transcription (IVT) is performed on a linearized DNA plasmid template containing the targeted coding sequence. Then, naked mRNA or mRNA complexed in a nanoparticle will be delivered systemically or locally. Subsequently, a part of the exogenous naked mRNA or complexed mRNA will go through cell-specific mechanisms. Once in the cytoplasm, the IVT mRNA is translated by the protein synthesis machinery
		- **Challenge:** primary challenges of RNA therapy center on delivering the RNA to the appropriate cells. These challenges include:
			- Naked RNA sequences naturally degrade after preparation
			- RNA sequences may trigger the body's immune system to attack them as an invader
			- RNA sequences are impermeable to the cell membrane.
		- **Solution:** methods that have been researched to improve the delivery system of mRNA are using [microinjection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microinjection "Microinjection"), RNA patches (mRNA loaded in a dissolving micro-needle), [gene gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_gun "Gene gun"), [protamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protamine "Protamine") condensation, RNA [adjuvants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant "Adjuvant"), and encapsulating mRNA in nanoparticles with lipids
	- **Antisense RNA (asRNA)**
		- asRNA is a single-stranded RNA that is complementary to a protein coding mRNA with which it hybridizes and thereby blocks its translation into protein. The primary function of asRNA is regulating gene expression. asRNAs have found widespread use as research tools for gene knockdown (an experimental technique by which gene expression of one or more of an organism's genes is reduced)
		- asRNAs can also be promising targets for drugs. Drugs tend to downregulate whatever they bind to (by blocking some function of the molecule when they bind to it). Hence, it has historically been difficult to use drugs to *upregulate* desired genes, such as tumor suppressor genes and neuroprotective growth factors. Drugs can then target asRNAs and downregulate their blocking of specific mRNAs to, in turn, upregulate those genes. This should, in theory, be easier than the current approaches of enzyme replacement therapies and microRNA therapies.
	- **RNA interference (RNAi)**
		- RNAi is a biological process in which RNA molecules are involved in sequence-specific suppression of gene expression by double-stranded RNA, through translational or transcriptional repression. microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) are central components to the RNAi pathway. There is a growing class of siRNA-based drugs that decrease the expression of proteins encoded by certain genes
		- **Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)** are short, 19-23 base-pair (with a 3' overhang of two nucleotides), double-stranded pieces of RNA that participate in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) for gene silencing. Specifically, siRNA is bound by the RISC complex where it is unwound using ATP hydrolysis. It is then used as a guide by the enzyme "Slicer" to target mRNAs for degradation based on complementary base-pairing to the target mRNA
		- **Micro RNAs (miRNAs)** are short, ~19-23 base pair long RNA oligonucleotides that are involved in the microRNA-induced silencing complex. Specifically, once loaded onto the ARGONAUTE enzyme, miRNAs work with mRNAs to repress translation and post-translationally destabilize mRNA. While they are functionally similar to siRNAs, miRNAs do not require extensive base-pairing for mRNA silencing (can require as few as seven base-pairs with target), thus allowing them to broadly affect a wider range of mRNA targets. In the cell, miRNA uses switch, tuning, and neutral interactions to finely regulate gene repression. As a therapeutic, miRNA has the potential to affect biochemical pathways throughout the organism.
	- **RNA aptamers**
		- RNA aptamers are oligomers (molecules consisting of a few repeating subunits that could be derived from monomers) that bind to a specific target molecule or family of target molecules. Aptamers and antibodies can be used in many of the same applications, but the nucleic acid-based structure of RNA aptamers is very different from the amino acid-based structure of antibodies. This difference can make aptamers a better choice than antibodies for some purposes.
		- Aptamers are much smaller in size and mass than antibodies, which could be a relevant factor in choosing which is best suited for a given application. When aptamers are available for a particular application, their advantages over antibodies include potentially lower immunogenicity, greater replicability and lower cost, a greater level of control due to the _in vitro_ selection conditions, and capacity to be efficiently engineered for durability, specificity, and sensitivity.
			- Because aptamers are nucleic-acid based, they can be directly synthesized, eliminating the need for cell-based expression and extraction as is the case in antibody production
## RNA-based Therapeutics: Current Progress and Future Prospects (2013)
- Emerging RNA drugs include:
	- Therapeutic ribozymes
	- Aptamers
	- Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)
- Limitations: RNA is inherently unstable, potentially immunogenic, and typically requires a delivery vehicle for efficient transport to the targeted cells
	- Note: immunogenic - relating to or denoting substances able to produce an immune response.
	- RNA is inherently unstable because it contains a hydroxyl group, which makes it more susceptible to hydrolysis and degradation than DNA. It also has ribose sugars, which are more reactive than DNA's deoxyribose sugar. Lastly, it has larger helical grooves than DNA, making it easier for enzymes to attack.
- RNA-based therapeutics can be classified by the mechanism of activity
	- Inhibitors of mRNA translation (antisense)
	- Agents of RNA interference (RNAi)
	- Catalytically active RNA molecules (ribozymes)
	- RNA that bind proteins and other molecular ligands (aptamers)
