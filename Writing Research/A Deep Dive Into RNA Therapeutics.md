# Notes
## RNA (Wikipedia)
- RNA is a molecule that is essential for most biological functions. It comes in two broad types:
	- Non-coding RNA: performs functions itself
	- Messenger RNA (mRNA): provides a template for the production of proteins
- Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules deliver amino acids to the ribosome, where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) then links amino acids together to form coded proteins
- The chemical structure of RNA is very similar to that of DNA, but differs in three primary ways:
	- Unlike double-stranded DNA, RNA is usually a single-stranded molecule in many of its biological roles and consists of much shorter chains of nucleotides. However, [double-stranded RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA#Double-stranded_RNA) (dsRNA) can form and (moreover) a single RNA molecule can, by complementary base pairing, form intrastrand double helixes, as in [tRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_RNA "Transfer RNA").
	- While the sugar-phosphate "backbone" of DNA contains _[deoxyribose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose "Deoxyribose")_, RNA contains _[ribose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribose "Ribose")_ instead. Ribose has a [hydroxyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxy_group "Hydroxy group") group attached to the pentose ring in the [2'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_nomenclature "Nucleic acid nomenclature") position, whereas deoxyribose does not. The hydroxyl groups in the ribose backbone make RNA more chemically [labile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lability "Lability") (i.e. more easily changeable or reactive) than DNA by lowering the [activation energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_energy "Activation energy") of [hydrolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis "Hydrolysis").
	- The complementary base to [adenine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine "Adenine") in DNA is [thymine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine "Thymine"), whereas in RNA, it is [uracil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil "Uracil"), which is an [unmethylated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation "Methylation") form of thymine.
- Like DNA, most biologically active RNAs, including [mRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA "MRNA"), [tRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRNA "TRNA"), [rRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RRNA "RRNA"), [snRNAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SnRNA "SnRNA"), and other [non-coding RNAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_RNA "Non-coding RNA"), contain self-complementary sequences that allow parts of the RNA to fold and pair with itself to form double helices. Analysis of these RNAs has revealed that they are highly structured. Unlike DNA, their structures do not consist of long double helices, but rather collections of short helices packed together into structures akin to proteins.
- The functional form of single-stranded RNA molecules, just like proteins, frequently requires a specific [tertiary structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_Tertiary_Structure "RNA Tertiary Structure"). The scaffold for this structure is provided by [secondary structural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure "Secondary structure") elements that are hydrogen bonds within the molecule.
- About 97% of transcriptional output (i.e. DNA to RNA transcription) results in non-protein-coding RNA in eukaryotes. These are all types of RNA *aside from* mRNA (which carries information from DNA to the ribosome for protein production)
## RNA Therapeutics (Wikipedia)
- **The main types of RNA therapeutics are based on**
	- **Messenger RNA (mRNA)**
		- Responsible for bringing genetic data (i.e. one codon of 3 nucleotides) to ribosomes to produce amino acids. Comes as a result of the transcription step. The administration of a nucleoside-modified mRNA sequence can cause a cell to make a protein, which in turn could directly treat a disease or could function as a vaccine
		- mRNA-based therapy is the only type which is based on triggering synthesis of proteins within cells, making it particularly useful in vaccine development
		- DNA therapeutics needs access to the nucleus to be transcribed into RNA, and its functionality depends on nuclear envelope breakdown during cell division. However, mRNA therapeutics do not need to enter into the nucleus to be functional since it will be translated immediately once it has reached to the cytoplasm. Moreover, unlike plasmids and viral vectors, mRNAs do not integrate into the genome and therefore do not have the risk of insertional mutagenesis, making them suitable for use in cancer vaccines, tumor immunotherapy and infectious disease prevention
		- **Mechanisms:** In vitro transcription (IVT) is performed on a linearized DNA plasmid template containing the targeted coding sequence. Then, naked mRNA or mRNA complexed in a nanoparticle will be delivered systemically or locally. Subsequently, a part of the exogenous naked mRNA or complexed mRNA will go through cell-specific mechanisms. Once in the cytoplasm, the IVT mRNA is translated by the protein synthesis machinery
		- **Challenge:** primary challenges of RNA therapy center on delivering the RNA to the appropriate cells. These challenges include:
			- Naked RNA sequences naturally degrade after preparation
			- RNA sequences may trigger the body's immune system to attack them as an invader
			- RNA sequences are impermeable to the cell membrane.
		- **Solution:** methods that have been researched to improve the delivery system of mRNA are using [microinjection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microinjection "Microinjection"), RNA patches (mRNA loaded in a dissolving micro-needle), [gene gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_gun "Gene gun"), [protamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protamine "Protamine") condensation, RNA [adjuvants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant "Adjuvant"), and encapsulating mRNA in nanoparticles with lipids
	- **Antisense RNA (asRNA)**
		- asRNA is a single-stranded RNA that is complementary to a protein coding mRNA with which it hybridizes and thereby blocks its translation into protein. The primary function of asRNA is regulating gene expression. asRNAs have found widespread use as research tools for gene knockdown (an experimental technique by which gene expression of one or more of an organism's genes is reduced)
		- asRNAs can also be promising targets for drugs. Drugs tend to downregulate whatever they bind to (by blocking some function of the molecule when they bind to it). Hence, it has historically been difficult to use drugs to *upregulate* desired genes, such as tumor suppressor genes and neuroprotective growth factors. Drugs can then target asRNAs and downregulate their blocking of specific mRNAs to, in turn, upregulate those genes. This should, in theory, be easier than the current approaches of enzyme replacement therapies and microRNA therapies.
	- **RNA interference (RNAi)**
		- RNAi is a biological process in which RNA molecules are involved in sequence-specific suppression of gene expression by double-stranded RNA, through translational or transcriptional repression. microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) are central components to the RNAi pathway. There is a growing class of siRNA-based drugs that decrease the expression of proteins encoded by certain genes
		- **Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)** are short, 19-23 base-pair (with a 3' overhang of two nucleotides), double-stranded pieces of RNA that participate in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) for gene silencing. Specifically, siRNA is bound by the RISC complex where it is unwound using ATP hydrolysis. It is then used as a guide by the enzyme "Slicer" to target mRNAs for degradation based on complementary base-pairing to the target mRNA
		- **Micro RNAs (miRNAs)** are short, ~19-23 base pair long RNA oligonucleotides that are involved in the microRNA-induced silencing complex. Specifically, once loaded onto the ARGONAUTE enzyme, miRNAs work with mRNAs to repress translation and post-translationally destabilize mRNA. While they are functionally similar to siRNAs, miRNAs do not require extensive base-pairing for mRNA silencing (can require as few as seven base-pairs with target), thus allowing them to broadly affect a wider range of mRNA targets. In the cell, miRNA uses switch, tuning, and neutral interactions to finely regulate gene repression. As a therapeutic, miRNA has the potential to affect biochemical pathways throughout the organism.
	- **RNA aptamers**
		- RNA aptamers are oligomers (molecules consisting of a few repeating subunits that could be derived from monomers) that bind to a specific target molecule or family of target molecules. Aptamers and antibodies can be used in many of the same applications, but the nucleic acid-based structure of RNA aptamers is very different from the amino acid-based structure of antibodies. This difference can make aptamers a better choice than antibodies for some purposes.
		- Aptamers are much smaller in size and mass than antibodies, which could be a relevant factor in choosing which is best suited for a given application. When aptamers are available for a particular application, their advantages over antibodies include potentially lower immunogenicity, greater replicability and lower cost, a greater level of control due to the _in vitro_ selection conditions, and capacity to be efficiently engineered for durability, specificity, and sensitivity.
			- Because aptamers are nucleic-acid based, they can be directly synthesized, eliminating the need for cell-based expression and extraction as is the case in antibody production
## Paving the Road for RNA Therapeutics (2020)
## The Limitless Future of RNA Therapeutics (2021)
- Traditional drug discovery relies on the ability of small molecule drugs to target active sites of proteins so as to inhibit or alter their function. 
	- Only ~1.5% of the human genome encodes proteins and only 10-14% of those coded-for proteins have active sites that are druggable. Hence, only a very small portion of what the human genome does can be modified by using small molecules to target proteins
- RNA drugs have largely focused on two approaches
	1. Antisense RNA (RNAi), where short oligonucleotides recognize and hybridize to form complementary sequences in endogenous RNA transcripts and alter their processing
	2. Message RNA (mRNA), where mRNAs encoding certain peptides or proteins elicit their transient expression in the cytoplasm (for instance, to replace defective proteins or present antigens for vaccination)
- Development of RNA therapeutics required that several major hurdles be overcome:
	1. Rapid degradation of exogenous RNA by RNases that are ubiquitous in the environment and tissues
	2. Delivery of negatively charged RNA across hydrophobic cytoplasmic membrane
	3. Strong immunogenicity of exogenous RNA that causes cell toxicity and impaired translation into therapeutic proteins
- Advantages of RNA-based drugs are:
	1. Their ability to act on targets that are otherwise "undruggable" for a small molecule or protein
	2. Their rapid and cost effective development when compared to small molecules or recombinant proteins
	3. The ability to rapidly alter the sequence of the mRNA construct for personalized treatments or to adapt to an evolving pathogen
- Broadly, we can classify RNA therapeutics into two groups - those that inhibit translation or promote degradation, and those that promote the expression of a specific protein or antigen (see below image).
![[Pasted image 20240708170349.png]]
- There are several therapeutic modalities that utilizes mRNA:
	1. Replacement therapy, where mRNA is administered to the patient to compensate for a defective gene/protein or to supply therapeutic proteins (see image below)
	2. Vaccination, where mRNA encoding specific antigen(s) is administered to elicit protective immunity
	3. Cell therapy, where mRNA is transfected into the cells *ex vivo* to alter the cell phenotype or function, and then these cells are delivered into the patient
![[Pasted image 20240708171929.png]]
- mRNA vaccine development in response to the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the speed and flexibility of mRNA vaccines:
	- After sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, it took 2 days to select the appropriate sequence for the Moderna vaccine candidate, 25 days to manufacture the first clinical batch of mRNA-1273, and another 35 days to dose the first trial participant. This gives a total of **only 62 days from genome sequencing to first trial dose of the vaccine**.
- mRNA vaccines have some advantages over DNA vaccines and viral vector vaccines
	1. mRNA vaccines are not confounded by pre-existing immunity against the vector (as in viral vector vaccines)
	2. mRNA vaccines do not need to enter the nucleus for translation (unlike plasmid DNA vaccines)
- Self-amplifying mRNA vaccines include an antigen-encoding sequence along with other elements required for replication (typically derived from an alphavirus, a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with a high capacity for replication). This allows for significantly higher amounts of the antigen to be expressed for a given dose of mRNA. See below image for a diagram of its function
![[Pasted image 20240708173008.png]]
- Targeted delivery is a major hurdle for RNA therapeutics:
	- RNA requires delivery vehicles that will protect the cargo from RNase degradation
	- RNA needs to be delivered to the site of therapeutic action
	- RNA needs assistance crossing the cell membrane and entering the cytoplasm where it may exert its effect
- RNA therapeutic delivery mechanisms:
	- Lipid-based nanoparticles
		- Liposomes are formed when materials containing polar head groups and non-polar tails (phospholipids) are dispersed in aqueous phase. They are spherical vesicles consisting of at least one phospholipid bilayer enclosing an aqueous core.
		- They are a flexible drug delivery particle which may have various surface modifications capable of delivering a variety of therapeutic payloads
		- Liposomes have an inherent advantage in that they mimic cell membrane composition and can encapsulate mRNA when combined with cationic lipids
		- Liposome delivery systems have some flaws:
			1. Liposomes are less stable and may fuse or leak RNA
			2. They entrap less RNA
			3. They can be harmful if oxidized
			4. They are not consistent in size (heterogeneity of the particles increases batch to batch variability)
		- Advances in surface modifications of liposomes are mitigating some of these flaws (for example, the mRNA COVID vaccines are delivered using liposomes)
		- The surface of the lipid nanoparticles can be modified to improve targeting to specific proteins. The nanoparticle can also transport peptides, hydrophobic small molecules, and hydrophilic small molecules in addition to nucleic acids
		![[Pasted image 20240708174145.png]]
	- Polymer nanomaterials
		- Polymer nanomaterials normally refer to synthetic compounds made of a handful of base units that come together to form complex structures
		- Advantages include:
			- A long shelf life
			- The ability to encapsulate hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds and proteins
			- The capability for tuned delivery of therapeutic compounds
		- Tend to induce inflammation within the immediate microenvironment, due either to lack of degradation or through byproducts
	- Silica nanoparticles
		- Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) have gained more attention for their therapeutic applications. The nanoparticles consist of an amorphous silica (silicon dioxide) matrix with ordered porosity in the mesoporous range. The peculiar feature of this nanoparticle includes large surface areas with large pore volumes, ease of modification, and established silanol chemistry.
		- The surface of the nanoparticles can be modified by positively charged moieties to transport negatively charged RNA.
		- The particles have high loading capacity for nucleic acids and efficient delivery. RNA can be loaded inside pores for their transport and the surface can be modified with cancer specific ligands and antibodies to deliver the RNA to the target site.
		- Particle aggregation is a hurdle that must be overcome so that the product is safe for injection. Aggregation can cause thrombosis or induce tissue injury
	- Carbon and gold nanoparticles
		- Gold nanoparticles, quantum dots, nanographene oxide, carbon nanotubes are each synthesized nanostructures that have the capacity to harbor RNA, protecting it from degradation and delivering it to the targeted disease site
	- N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)
		- GalNAc is a trivalent ligand that binds to asialoglycoprotein (ASGPR) receptors in hepatocytes.
		- Clinical studies suggest that GalNAc conjugated siRNAs are very efficient to knockdown gene expression in the liver
- Why have mRNA therapeutics exploded in popularity and investment recently? They have some inherent advantages:
	- **Fast Cycle Times:** High-purity RNA constructs can be generated much faster than traditional small molecule drugs or recombinant proteins
	- **Low Relative Investment:** RNA is cheaper to manufacture than small molecules or recombinant proteins
	- **Flexible Manufacturing Process:** the manufacturing process is adaptable to any RNA sequence, allowing for personalized RNA therapeutics
	- **Lower Regulatory Burden:** RNA has a superior safety profile and simpler regulatory roadmap compared to DNA-based gene therapy because it doesn't integrate into the host genome
- mRNA therapeutics are a disruptive therapeutic technology, as small biotech startups, as well as academic groups, can rapidly develop new and personalized mRNA constructs.
