# Notes
## RNA (Wikipedia)
- RNA is a molecule that is essential for most biological functions. It comes in two broad types:
	- Non-coding RNA: performs functions itself
	- Messenger RNA (mRNA): provides a template for the production of proteins
- Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules deliver amino acids to the ribosome, where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) then links amino acids together to form coded proteins
- The chemical structure of RNA is very similar to that of DNA, but differs in three primary ways:
	- Unlike double-stranded DNA, RNA is usually a single-stranded molecule in many of its biological roles and consists of much shorter chains of nucleotides. However, [double-stranded RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA#Double-stranded_RNA) (dsRNA) can form and (moreover) a single RNA molecule can, by complementary base pairing, form intrastrand double helixes, as in [tRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_RNA "Transfer RNA").
	- While the sugar-phosphate "backbone" of DNA contains _[deoxyribose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose "Deoxyribose")_, RNA contains _[ribose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribose "Ribose")_ instead. Ribose has a [hydroxyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxy_group "Hydroxy group") group attached to the pentose ring in the [2'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_nomenclature "Nucleic acid nomenclature") position, whereas deoxyribose does not. The hydroxyl groups in the ribose backbone make RNA more chemically [labile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lability "Lability") (i.e. more easily changeable or reactive) than DNA by lowering the [activation energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_energy "Activation energy") of [hydrolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis "Hydrolysis").
	- The complementary base to [adenine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine "Adenine") in DNA is [thymine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine "Thymine"), whereas in RNA, it is [uracil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil "Uracil"), which is an [unmethylated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation "Methylation") form of thymine.
- Like DNA, most biologically active RNAs, including [mRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA "MRNA"), [tRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRNA "TRNA"), [rRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RRNA "RRNA"), [snRNAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SnRNA "SnRNA"), and other [non-coding RNAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_RNA "Non-coding RNA"), contain self-complementary sequences that allow parts of the RNA to fold and pair with itself to form double helices. Analysis of these RNAs has revealed that they are highly structured. Unlike DNA, their structures do not consist of long double helices, but rather collections of short helices packed together into structures akin to proteins.
- The functional form of single-stranded RNA molecules, just like proteins, frequently requires a specific [tertiary structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_Tertiary_Structure "RNA Tertiary Structure"). The scaffold for this structure is provided by [secondary structural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure "Secondary structure") elements that are hydrogen bonds within the molecule.
- About 97% of transcriptional output (i.e. DNA to RNA transcription) results in non-protein-coding RNA in eukaryotes. These are all types of RNA *aside from* mRNA (which carries information from DNA to the ribosome for protein production)
## RNA Therapeutics (Wikipedia)
- **The main types of RNA therapeutics are based on**
	- **Messenger RNA (mRNA)**
		- Responsible for bringing genetic data (i.e. one codon of 3 nucleotides) to ribosomes to produce amino acids. Comes as a result of the transcription step. The administration of a nucleoside-modified mRNA sequence can cause a cell to make a protein, which in turn could directly treat a disease or could function as a vaccine
		- mRNA-based therapy is the only type which is based on triggering synthesis of proteins within cells, making it particularly useful in vaccine development
		- DNA therapeutics needs access to the nucleus to be transcribed into RNA, and its functionality depends on nuclear envelope breakdown during cell division. However, mRNA therapeutics do not need to enter into the nucleus to be functional since it will be translated immediately once it has reached to the cytoplasm. Moreover, unlike plasmids and viral vectors, mRNAs do not integrate into the genome and therefore do not have the risk of insertional mutagenesis, making them suitable for use in cancer vaccines, tumor immunotherapy and infectious disease prevention
		- **Mechanisms:** In vitro transcription (IVT) is performed on a linearized DNA plasmid template containing the targeted coding sequence. Then, naked mRNA or mRNA complexed in a nanoparticle will be delivered systemically or locally. Subsequently, a part of the exogenous naked mRNA or complexed mRNA will go through cell-specific mechanisms. Once in the cytoplasm, the IVT mRNA is translated by the protein synthesis machinery
		- **Challenge:** primary challenges of RNA therapy center on delivering the RNA to the appropriate cells. These challenges include:
			- Naked RNA sequences naturally degrade after preparation
			- RNA sequences may trigger the body's immune system to attack them as an invader
			- RNA sequences are impermeable to the cell membrane.
		- **Solution:** methods that have been researched to improve the delivery system of mRNA are using [microinjection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microinjection "Microinjection"), RNA patches (mRNA loaded in a dissolving micro-needle), [gene gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_gun "Gene gun"), [protamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protamine "Protamine") condensation, RNA [adjuvants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant "Adjuvant"), and encapsulating mRNA in nanoparticles with lipids
	- **Antisense RNA (asRNA)**
		- asRNA is a single-stranded RNA that is complementary to a protein coding mRNA with which it hybridizes and thereby blocks its translation into protein. The primary function of asRNA is regulating gene expression. asRNAs have found widespread use as research tools for gene knockdown (an experimental technique by which gene expression of one or more of an organism's genes is reduced)
		- asRNAs can also be promising targets for drugs. Drugs tend to downregulate whatever they bind to (by blocking some function of the molecule when they bind to it). Hence, it has historically been difficult to use drugs to *upregulate* desired genes, such as tumor suppressor genes and neuroprotective growth factors. Drugs can then target asRNAs and downregulate their blocking of specific mRNAs to, in turn, upregulate those genes. This should, in theory, be easier than the current approaches of enzyme replacement therapies and microRNA therapies.
	- **RNA interference (RNAi)**
		- RNAi is a biological process in which RNA molecules are involved in sequence-specific suppression of gene expression by double-stranded RNA, through translational or transcriptional repression. microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) are central components to the RNAi pathway. There is a growing class of siRNA-based drugs that decrease the expression of proteins encoded by certain genes
		- **Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)** are short, 19-23 base-pair (with a 3' overhang of two nucleotides), double-stranded pieces of RNA that participate in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) for gene silencing. Specifically, siRNA is bound by the RISC complex where it is unwound using ATP hydrolysis. It is then used as a guide by the enzyme "Slicer" to target mRNAs for degradation based on complementary base-pairing to the target mRNA
		- **Micro RNAs (miRNAs)** are short, ~19-23 base pair long RNA oligonucleotides that are involved in the microRNA-induced silencing complex. Specifically, once loaded onto the ARGONAUTE enzyme, miRNAs work with mRNAs to repress translation and post-translationally destabilize mRNA. While they are functionally similar to siRNAs, miRNAs do not require extensive base-pairing for mRNA silencing (can require as few as seven base-pairs with target), thus allowing them to broadly affect a wider range of mRNA targets. In the cell, miRNA uses switch, tuning, and neutral interactions to finely regulate gene repression. As a therapeutic, miRNA has the potential to affect biochemical pathways throughout the organism.
	- **RNA aptamers**
		- RNA aptamers are oligomers (molecules consisting of a few repeating subunits that could be derived from monomers) that bind to a specific target molecule or family of target molecules. Aptamers and antibodies can be used in many of the same applications, but the nucleic acid-based structure of RNA aptamers is very different from the amino acid-based structure of antibodies. This difference can make aptamers a better choice than antibodies for some purposes.
		- Aptamers are much smaller in size and mass than antibodies, which could be a relevant factor in choosing which is best suited for a given application. When aptamers are available for a particular application, their advantages over antibodies include potentially lower immunogenicity, greater replicability and lower cost, a greater level of control due to the _in vitro_ selection conditions, and capacity to be efficiently engineered for durability, specificity, and sensitivity.
			- Because aptamers are nucleic-acid based, they can be directly synthesized, eliminating the need for cell-based expression and extraction as is the case in antibody production
## Paving the Road for RNA Therapeutics (2020)
- Therapeutic RNA holds high potential for treatments, but there are obstacles with unmodified RNA molecules:
	- Rapidly degraded and cleared from circulation
	- Their large size and negative charge complicates their passing through the cell membrane
	- They need to be delivered to the target cell
- Pharma typically focuses on targeting proteins with small molecules. 
	- Advantages of small molecules include:
		- Ease of production
		- Possibility of oral administration
		- Favorable pharmacokinetics
		- Ability to pass through the cell membrane
	- Major disadvantage: it is estimated that of the ~20,000 human proteins, only ~3000 are druggable
		- As of 2017, approved drugs targeted only 667 human proteins
			- This not only indicates that more drugs can be developed to reach the 3000 druggable targets, but also highlights that the vast majority of 20 000 human proteins remain undruggable.
		- Whether a biological target is druggable or not depends on a variety of factors such as the presence of suitable pockets in the protein structure in which small molecules can dock, a suitable size to accommodate binding, and the degree of polarity. Docking into a deep cavity is crucial in achieving sufficiently high binding affinities
- Monoclonal antibodies (mABs) have entered the pharma scene as a response to some of the failings of small molecules
	- Advantages over small molecules include:
		- Longer half-life
		- Ability to target a broader group of proteins (due to the vast mAb repertoire)
		- Ability to be engineered to widen their applicability and increase their specificity
		- Lower toxicity
	- Disadvantages compared to small molecules include:
		- More complicated pharmacological profile
		- Higher cost of production
		- Limits in route of administration (mostly intravenous)
	- In 2018, 17 of the 59 newly approved drugs were biologics (biologics becoming increasingly important to treat disease)
- A new class of therapeutic is arising to address limitations of mABs and small molecules: nucleic-acid-based therapy
	- Includes:
		- Oligos
		- Plasmid DNA
		- mRNA
		- Ribozymes (RNA enzymes; RNA molecules with catalytic activity)
		- RNAi-related nucleic acids such as miRNA, siRNA, and short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
	- While the use of mAbs are limited to cell surface receptors or secreted proteins, nucleic acids can interfere with protein expression itself and therefore circumvent the druggability issue during drug development.
**The image below gives an overview of RNA-based therapies:**
![[Pasted image 20240709112634.png]]
**Figure 1. Overview of Different Mechanisms of Action of Different RNA Therapeutics.** (1) Without therapeutic RNA molecules, the translation of a pathogenic protein proceeds without inhibition (shown in the broken line box). (2) ASOs hybridize to the target mRNA, while the (3) siRNA/miRNA mimics utilize the RISC in the RNAi pathway to (4) inhibit translation of target mRNA. (5) Over expression of a therapeutic protein that counteracts the function of the pathogenic protein can be done by delivering the mRNA of the therapeutic protein. (6) saRNA can be delivered to the cell where it binds to AGO2, is imported to the nucleus, and in turn activates an endogenous gene. (7) A more permanent approach to remove the pathogenic protein is by gene knockout using Cas9 and sgRNA RNPs. Abbreviations: AGO2, argonaute 2; ASO, antisense oligonucleotide; RISC, RNA-induced silencing complex; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; saRNA, small activating RNA.

- **Types of RNA therapeutics**
	- **Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)**
		- Single-stranded oligonucleotides that are complementary to a target mRNA
		- Hybridize with mRNA and modulate protein expression (usually inhibit translation from mRNA to amino acids)
		- Can be based on DNA or RNA
		- ASOs can also increase translation efficiency of the target protein by sterically inhibiting the translation of an upstream open reading frame 
			- **Steric inhibition** involves physically blocking a biological process due to the spatial arrangement of molecules. In this context, it means that the binding of ASOs to a specific RNA region prevents the ribosome or other translation machinery from accessing and translating that region.
			- **An upstream open reading frame (uORF)** is a sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA that can be translated into a peptide, located upstream (5' end) of the main coding sequence (the primary open reading frame or ORF) of the gene. uORFs can regulate the translation of the downstream main ORF by affecting ribosome scanning and initiation processes.
				- **Function:** uORFs can regulate the translation of the main ORF in various ways:
					- **Ribosome Stalling:** When ribosomes initiate translation at a uORF, they may stall and dissociate after translating the uORF, reducing the number of ribosomes available to translate the main ORF.
					- **Reinitiation:** After translating a uORF, ribosomes may resume scanning and reinitiate translation at the main ORF, but this process can be less efficient.
					- **Regulatory Role:** uORFs often play a role in feedback mechanisms and can be involved in the response to cellular conditions, affecting the overall expression of the main protein.
	- **siRNA and miRNA**
		- siRNAs are short (20–25 nucleotides), double-stranded RNA molecules that use the RNAi pathway to degrade a target mRNA in a sequence-specific manner
			- Upon delivery into the cytoplasm, argonaute (AGO)2 cleaves the passenger (sense) strand and the guide (antisense) strand of the siRNA is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The guide strand then guides the RISC to the target mRNA which is recognized and cleaved
		- miRNA mimics are synthetic, double-stranded RNAs that mimic a naturally occurring miRNA. These miRNA mimics can replenish altered miRNA functionality. For instance, in certain types of cancer, miRNAs that silence oncogenes are downregulated and miRNA mimics can give a therapeutic effect in such cases
	- **mRNA**
		- mRNA is seen as a safer alternative to DNA for therapeutic purposes such as protein replacement therapy, as it degrades quickly leading to no concerns about potential adverse effects from long-lasting expression or genomic integration.
		- Some disadvantages relative to DNA therapy:
			- mRNA expression is more difficult to regulate than DNA expression, leading to possible toxicity from mRNA expression at off-target sites (leading to unwanted protein expression)
			- mRNA is unstable and so it can degrade before it has had a therapeutic effect
		- The field of mRNA therapeutics received a major boost only as advances in chemistry created more stable modified nucleotides and sophisticated regulation systems for mRNA expression were generated
		- Some roles for mRNA therapies:
			- Protein replacement therapy
			- Vaccines for infections diseases (e.g. expression of viral antigens in dendritic cells)
			- *in vivo* production of mAbs
	- **RNA Aptamers**
		- Aptamers are short single-stranded oligonucleotides that can consist of both DNA and RNA. RNA Aptamers are defined as **RNA oligonucleotides that bind to a specific target with high affinity and specificity**, similarly to how an antibody binds to an antigen.
		- Besides the therapeutic potential of RNA aptamers, aptamers are also used solely as targeting moieties to aid delivery of other RNA payloads such as siRNA
			- **Targeting moieties** are specific molecules or molecular structures that are used to direct the delivery of therapeutic agents (such as drugs, siRNA, or other biologically active molecules) to specific cells, tissues, or organs within the body. By binding selectively to target cells or receptors, these moieties enhance the specificity and efficiency of the delivery process, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes and reducing off-target effects.
	- **saRNA**
		- saRNAs are 21-nucleotide, double-stranded, noncoding RNA that possess two nucleotide overhangs on both ends
		- saRNAs are initially loaded on the AGO2 protein where the passenger strand is cleaved. The saRNA–AGO2 complex then enters the nucleus and binds to promoter regions of genes to enhance transcription
	- **gRNA for CRISPR/Cas9-Directed Knockout**
		- The codelivery of Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA against a certain genomic target has promising applications for gene knock out strategies

- The high immunogenicity combined with low RNA stability necessitates chemical modifications of the RNA molecule to make advancement to the clinic more realistic
	- Such modifications can involve alterations of the ribose group, the phosphate backbone, the RNA termini, or modification of the nucleobases themselves
- The major challenge in RNA therapeutics is delivery and difficulties in intracellular uptake of RNA molecules due to the large molecular weight and negatively charged phosphate backbone that hinders internalization
	- While chemical modifications of the RNA molecules dramatically increase the stability and decrease the immunogenicity, intravenous injection of naked RNA remains challenging where multiple barriers hamper RNA uptake. Cellular barriers include difficulties in both passing of the cell membrane as well as the subsequent endosomal escape. While other RNA molecules might be hampered with these cellular barriers, naked mRNA delivery somewhat circumvents these barriers as dendritic cells actively internalize naked mRNA by micropinocytosis. Another barrier is the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), which effectively clears administered particulates through phagocytosis. Although the smaller RNA molecules such as siRNA are not taken up by the MPS, a disadvantage of the small size is the increased clearance rate by the kidneys as the glomerular filtration barrier limit is about 8 nm. Kidney clearance is therefore the major obstacle for intravenous administration of naked RNA
- Several delivery strategies can be used to enable safe and efficient delivery of RNA therapeutics:
	- RNA conjugated with a targeting moiety.
		- The attachment of an active targeting moiety such as an antibody to the RNA can aid in both tissue/cell targeting and in internalization into target cells. Although it does not directly protect the RNA against degradation, it facilitates accumulation into the cells of interest
		- Antibodies are a popular choice as targeting moieties due to their specificity, high affinity, well-defined structure, and long in vivo circulation time
		- Antibody-RNA conjugation methods can include either a covalent attachment or a non-covalent attachment. 
	- Aptamers
		- Aptamers have been used to direct therapeutic RNA molecules to target sites
		- In terms of specificity and affinity, they are highly comparable to antibodies but are smaller, have a higher stability, and are easier to generate
	- Lipid nanoparticles
		- Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are complex and large structures (~100 nm) that also have been used to deliver large RNA molecules such as mRNA *in vivo*
		- LNPs can encapsulate large amounts of RNA and protect them against RNase degradation and renal clearance
	- Polymers
		- Cationic polymers are well suited for the delivery of RNA due to their positive charge, chemical diversity, and compatibility with various targeting moieties

![[Pasted image 20240709164013.png]]
**Figure 2. Examples of Delivery Vehicles for Different RNA Payloads:** (A) Antibody conjugated to RNA molecules which can be mediated by using for instance positively charged protamine (shown as plus signs). (B) Conjugate of RNA with a single-chain variable fragment (scFv). (C) RNA–aptamer conjugates. (D) RNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Cationic or ionizable lipids (shown in green) aid in encapsulating the RNA payload through electrostatic interactions. This way, the RNA is encapsulated in inverted micelles. Cholesterol (shown in grey) provides stability to the LNPs. The surface of the LNPs are generally coated with PEG (black lines). Reactive groups such as maleimide (purple triangles) can be linked to the PEG and are used to functionalize the LNPs with targeting moieties (chemical conjugation of targeting moieties). (E) Cationic polymers can encapsulate RNA therapeutics by electrostatic interactions.

- Considerations for future work in RNA therapies:
	- **Challenge:** Most RNA-based therapeutics are chemically modified RNAs and it is important to pay attention to potential adverse effects of these modifications. Not only does modified RNA differ structurally from unmodified RNA but it can also affect the functionality. Therefore, some caution is necessary when focusing on an improved pharmacokinetic profile of synthetic RNA molecules with disregard to altered biological functionalities that might not be directly visible.
		- **Potential Solution:** To address this issue, a new class of RNAs has been explored. These are the bioengineered RNA agents (BERAs), which are made and folded in living cells and demonstrate favorable stability in human cells. They could represent a more natural alternative to the extensively chemical modified RNAs currently used
	- **Challenge:** In terms of delivery of RNA therapeutics, most strategies have focused on the ‘low-hanging fruit’ by delivering the RNA to the liver and most drug candidates have hence focused on liver- and kidney-related diseases (with some upcoming potential in the central nervous system as well). Future ambitions should focus on sites in the body that are harder to reach such as leukocytes that are dispersed over the body and intrinsically hard to transfect
		- **Potential Solution**:** Currently, it seems that this necessitates the inclusion of targeting moieties such as peptides, antibodies, other proteins, polysaccharides, and more. Besides cell targeting, such targeting moieties might also aid in enhancing internalization of the payload.
	- **Challenge:** Internalization and endosomal escape is a real bottleneck in RNA delivery. While a small fraction of siRNA release in the cytosol is sufficient for knockdown, other RNA-based approaches still lack potency due to endosomal entrapment
		- No potential solution given
## The Limitless Future of RNA Therapeutics (2021)
- Traditional drug discovery relies on the ability of small molecule drugs to target active sites of proteins so as to inhibit or alter their function. 
	- Only ~1.5% of the human genome encodes proteins and only 10-14% of those coded-for proteins have active sites that are druggable. Hence, only a very small portion of what the human genome does can be modified by using small molecules to target proteins
- RNA drugs have largely focused on two approaches
	1. Antisense RNA (RNAi), where short oligonucleotides recognize and hybridize to form complementary sequences in endogenous RNA transcripts and alter their processing
	2. Message RNA (mRNA), where mRNAs encoding certain peptides or proteins elicit their transient expression in the cytoplasm (for instance, to replace defective proteins or present antigens for vaccination)
- Development of RNA therapeutics required that several major hurdles be overcome:
	1. Rapid degradation of exogenous RNA by RNases that are ubiquitous in the environment and tissues
	2. Delivery of negatively charged RNA across hydrophobic cytoplasmic membrane
	3. Strong immunogenicity of exogenous RNA that causes cell toxicity and impaired translation into therapeutic proteins
- Advantages of RNA-based drugs are:
	1. Their ability to act on targets that are otherwise "undruggable" for a small molecule or protein
	2. Their rapid and cost effective development when compared to small molecules or recombinant proteins
	3. The ability to rapidly alter the sequence of the mRNA construct for personalized treatments or to adapt to an evolving pathogen
- Broadly, we can classify RNA therapeutics into two groups - those that inhibit translation or promote degradation, and those that promote the expression of a specific protein or antigen (see below image).
![[Pasted image 20240708170349.png]]
- There are several therapeutic modalities that utilizes mRNA:
	1. Replacement therapy, where mRNA is administered to the patient to compensate for a defective gene/protein or to supply therapeutic proteins (see image below)
	2. Vaccination, where mRNA encoding specific antigen(s) is administered to elicit protective immunity
	3. Cell therapy, where mRNA is transfected into the cells *ex vivo* to alter the cell phenotype or function, and then these cells are delivered into the patient
![[Pasted image 20240708171929.png]]
- mRNA vaccine development in response to the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the speed and flexibility of mRNA vaccines:
	- After sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, it took 2 days to select the appropriate sequence for the Moderna vaccine candidate, 25 days to manufacture the first clinical batch of mRNA-1273, and another 35 days to dose the first trial participant. This gives a total of **only 62 days from genome sequencing to first trial dose of the vaccine**.
- mRNA vaccines have some advantages over DNA vaccines and viral vector vaccines
	1. mRNA vaccines are not confounded by pre-existing immunity against the vector (as in viral vector vaccines)
	2. mRNA vaccines do not need to enter the nucleus for translation (unlike plasmid DNA vaccines)
- Self-amplifying mRNA vaccines include an antigen-encoding sequence along with other elements required for replication (typically derived from an alphavirus, a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with a high capacity for replication). This allows for significantly higher amounts of the antigen to be expressed for a given dose of mRNA. See below image for a diagram of its function
![[Pasted image 20240708173008.png]]
- Targeted delivery is a major hurdle for RNA therapeutics:
	- RNA requires delivery vehicles that will protect the cargo from RNase degradation
	- RNA needs to be delivered to the site of therapeutic action
	- RNA needs assistance crossing the cell membrane and entering the cytoplasm where it may exert its effect
- RNA therapeutic delivery mechanisms:
	- Lipid-based nanoparticles
		- Liposomes are formed when materials containing polar head groups and non-polar tails (phospholipids) are dispersed in aqueous phase. They are spherical vesicles consisting of at least one phospholipid bilayer enclosing an aqueous core.
		- They are a flexible drug delivery particle which may have various surface modifications capable of delivering a variety of therapeutic payloads
		- Liposomes have an inherent advantage in that they mimic cell membrane composition and can encapsulate mRNA when combined with cationic lipids
		- Liposome delivery systems have some flaws:
			1. Liposomes are less stable and may fuse or leak RNA
			2. They entrap less RNA
			3. They can be harmful if oxidized
			4. They are not consistent in size (heterogeneity of the particles increases batch to batch variability)
		- Advances in surface modifications of liposomes are mitigating some of these flaws (for example, the mRNA COVID vaccines are delivered using liposomes)
		- The surface of the lipid nanoparticles can be modified to improve targeting to specific proteins. The nanoparticle can also transport peptides, hydrophobic small molecules, and hydrophilic small molecules in addition to nucleic acids
		![[Pasted image 20240708174145.png]]
	- Polymer nanomaterials
		- Polymer nanomaterials normally refer to synthetic compounds made of a handful of base units that come together to form complex structures
		- Advantages include:
			- A long shelf life
			- The ability to encapsulate hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds and proteins
			- The capability for tuned delivery of therapeutic compounds
		- Tend to induce inflammation within the immediate microenvironment, due either to lack of degradation or through byproducts
	- Silica nanoparticles
		- Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) have gained more attention for their therapeutic applications. The nanoparticles consist of an amorphous silica (silicon dioxide) matrix with ordered porosity in the mesoporous range. The peculiar feature of this nanoparticle includes large surface areas with large pore volumes, ease of modification, and established silanol chemistry.
		- The surface of the nanoparticles can be modified by positively charged moieties to transport negatively charged RNA.
		- The particles have high loading capacity for nucleic acids and efficient delivery. RNA can be loaded inside pores for their transport and the surface can be modified with cancer specific ligands and antibodies to deliver the RNA to the target site.
		- Particle aggregation is a hurdle that must be overcome so that the product is safe for injection. Aggregation can cause thrombosis or induce tissue injury
	- Carbon and gold nanoparticles
		- Gold nanoparticles, quantum dots, nanographene oxide, carbon nanotubes are each synthesized nanostructures that have the capacity to harbor RNA, protecting it from degradation and delivering it to the targeted disease site
	- N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)
		- GalNAc is a trivalent ligand that binds to asialoglycoprotein (ASGPR) receptors in hepatocytes.
		- Clinical studies suggest that GalNAc conjugated siRNAs are very efficient to knockdown gene expression in the liver
- Why have mRNA therapeutics exploded in popularity and investment recently? They have some inherent advantages:
	- **Fast Cycle Times:** High-purity RNA constructs can be generated much faster than traditional small molecule drugs or recombinant proteins
	- **Low Relative Investment:** RNA is cheaper to manufacture than small molecules or recombinant proteins
	- **Flexible Manufacturing Process:** the manufacturing process is adaptable to any RNA sequence, allowing for personalized RNA therapeutics
	- **Lower Regulatory Burden:** RNA has a superior safety profile and simpler regulatory roadmap compared to DNA-based gene therapy because it doesn't integrate into the host genome
- mRNA therapeutics are a disruptive therapeutic technology, as small biotech startups, as well as academic groups, can rapidly develop new and personalized mRNA constructs.
## Noncoding RNA Therapeutics: Challenges and Potential Solutions (2021)
- Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are generated from the larger part of the genome that does not encode proteins but produces noncoding transcripts that regulate gene expression and protein function.
- Two major classes of ncRNA are the well-studied short microRNAs (miRNAs) and the more recently identified long ncRNAs (lncRNAs)
	- Deregulation of both types of transcript has been linked to every cancer investigated to date and affects all major cancer hallmarks. Also associated with a number of other complex biological processes
		- Therapeutic targeting of such naturally occurring ncRNAs thus represents a very promising approach for the treatment of various diseases
- The use of miRNA-based therapeutics has dual advantages:
	- miRNAs are naturally occurring molecules in human cells, unlike man-made chemotherapy compounds or antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), and therefore have all the mechanisms in place for their processing and downstream target selection
	- miRNAs act by targeting multiple genes within one pathway, thus causing a broader yet specific response
	
**Fig. 1: MicroRNA biogenesis pathway and ways to interfere therapeutically.**
![[Pasted image 20240719094942.png]]
**Figure Caption:** MicroRNA (miRNA) biogenesis is a multistep process (see blue boxes) consisting of transcription of a pri-miRNA by RNA polymerase II or III, its nuclear processing into a pre-miRNA by Drosha and DGCR8, nuclear export of the pre-miRNA by exportin 5, cytoplasmic processing by Dicer and TRBP into a mature miRNA duplex and its helicase-mediated unwinding. The passenger strand is degraded, and the mature miRNA strand is integrated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to mediate either translational repression or mRNA degradation depending on the extent of complementarity to the mRNA target. Translational repression is mediated through effects on translation initiation, elongation and termination as well as co-translational degradation. mRNA degradation is mediated through mechanisms resulting first in mRNA deadenylation (step 1), followed by de-capping (step 2) and concluded by exonuclease-mediated 5′ to 3′ degradation (step 3). Ways to interfere with the endogenous miRNA pathway (see red boxes) include inhibition of biogenesis at the nuclear or cytoplasmic level, miRNA replacement therapy and functional inhibition of the mature miRNA or the interaction with its target mRNA. As oligonucleotides are not readily taken up into cells, commonly used delivery methods are shown and include conjugation to various chemical or biological entities as well as delivery within lipid particles, polymers and viral or bacterial vector systems.

- LncRNA targeting may include transcriptional inhibition, post-transcriptional inhibition, steric hindrance of secondary structure formation or protein interactions, introduction of synthetic (for example, circular) lncRNAs, and modulation of lncRNA genomic loci or expression patterns via CRISPR–Cas9 and CRISPR–Cas13, respectively
- Main issues facing all RNA-based therapeutics are:
	- Specificity
		- Undesired on-target effects due to uptake in cells other than the cells of interest
		- Off-target effects caused by either sequence similarities or overdosing to much higher than expected levels endogenously
	- Delivery
		- Instability of naked, chemically unmodified RNA structures
		- Inefficient intracellular delivery which requires the exploitation of endosomal escape mechanisms
		- Lack of delivery vehicles suitable for targeting the organ and cell type of interest
	- Tolerability
		-  Caused by the recognition of RNA structures by pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), leading to adverse immune effects.

- **Main characteristics of microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs**
	- **microRNAs (miRNAs)**
		- Small in size (17-25 nucleotides)
		- Single-stranded and non-coding (ncRNA) that act as gene regulators
		- Act through post-transcriptional gene silencing
			- Post-transcriptional == after DNA has been translated to mRNA for gene expression
		- The miRNA 'seed sequence' (i.e. the sequence that identified and binds to a particular mRNA) is situated from nucleotides 2 to 7 at the 5'-end of the miRNA sequence.
			- Seed sequence binding with *perfect* complementarity (i.e. the seed sequence exactly matches with a part of the mRNA) results in the deadenylation and degradation of the targeted mRNA
			- Seed sequence binding with *imperfect* complementarity (i.e. the seed sequence partially matches with part of the mRNA), which is more common, results in translational inhibition
	- **Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)**
		- Large in size (>200 nucleotides)
		- Synthesized similarly to mRNAs, but not translated into proteins
		- LncRNAs contain two types of functional element:
			- The *interactor elements* involved in direct physical interaction with other nucleic acids, with proteins or lipids
			- The *structural elements*, leading to the occurrence of secondary and/or tertiary 3D RNA structures, which direct their functional interactions
		- Can interact with DNA and RNA in linear form via base pairing *or* interact with DNA/RNA/proteins via chemical interactions in secondary structures (sort of acts like a protein and an RNA molecule!).
			- Allows for significantly more variable functions when compared to miRNAs
		- Gene-regulatory roles have been identified for many lncRNAs, for example, by influencing transcription factor binding or epigenetic marks
			- Interactions with mRNAs may influence their stability or rate of translation.
			- lncRNA–protein interactions may influence the stability, activity or localization of the protein
	
- **Types of RNA-targeting therapeutics**
	- RNA-targeting therapeutics are used to:
		1. Induce miRNA-like functions (i.e. inhibit mRNA translation and reduce gene expression)
		2. Restore or deplete the levels of a miRNA (i.e. downregulate/upregulate gene expression)
		3. Inhibit the interaction of a miRNA with its targets (i.e. upregulate gene expression)
	1. **Induce miRNA-like functions**
		- **Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)** are single-stranded DNA molecules with full complementarity to one select target mRNA and may act by blocking protein translation (via steric hindrance), causing mRNA degradation (via RNase H cleavage) or changing pre-mRNA splicing (via interference with _cis_-splicing elements causing exon inclusion or exclusion)
		- **Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)** may be single or double stranded and exploit the endogenous miRNA pathway and mediate silencing of one, fully complementary mRNA via their loading into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)
		- **Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs)** exploit the miRNA maturation pathway, being cleaved by Dicer into a double-stranded mature product before RISC loading. ShRNAs are traditionally introduced into cells using viral vector systems such as adenovirus-associated viruses, retroviruses or lentiviruses. Bifunctional shRNAs have higher knock-down efficacy as they simultaneously produce transcripts with perfect and imperfect complementarity to trigger degradation as well as translational inhibition
	2. **Restore or deplete the levels of miRNA**
		- **MiRNA mimics** exploit the main advantage of endogenous miRNAs being able to target multiple mRNAs at once. miRNA mimics have the same sequence as an endogenous miRNA while the passenger strand carries a few mismatches to prevent RISC loading and potential action as an anti-microRNA (antimiR)
		- **Anti-microRNAs (antimiRs)** are essentially ASOs designed to be fully or partially complementary to an endogenous miRNA to prevent the interaction with its target genes.
		- **MiRNA sponges** are artificial transcripts that contain multiple miRNA binding sites to trap and sequester it. miRNA sponges may target one specific or multiple different miRNAs
	3. **Inhibit the interaction of a miRNA with its targets**
		- **MiRNA-masking ASOs** represent an inverted approach that masks the binding site of a miRNA within the target gene and offers a gene-specific and safe therapeutic strategy in cases where seed-family members have dual effects.
	- **LncRNA therapeutics** have only become the focus of investigations in the past decade and no lncRNA-targeting therapeutics have entered clinical development so far. LncRNAs are being actively explored as biomarkers, supporting their prevalent link with diseases. In the future, lncRNAs are expected to broaden the amount of RNA interference (RNAi) and CRISPR targets, and specific lncRNA types such as circular RNAs or natural antisense transcripts represent entirely new therapeutic approaches.

- **Targeting RNA viruses with RNA-based therapeutics**
	- Positive-strand RNA viruses resemble endogenous mRNAs and can consequently be directly bound and regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs).
		- This can influence viral replication positively or negatively via various mechanisms such as RNA stabilization, and thus differs from miRNA interaction with endogenous mRNAs, which generally results in downregulation (see figure below)
		- In addition, viral infection may sequester endogenous miRNAs or change their expression, which can similarly lead to pro- or antiviral effects
	- Both miRNA replacement and miRNA inhibitory therapeutics can be applicable for the treatment of viral infection.
