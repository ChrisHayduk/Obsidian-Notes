# Sketch of Idea
- Free markets have successfully made society significantly richer because they have built-in mechanisms for rejuvenation. The cycle goes:
	1. A new technology/methodology/market becomes available
	2. New companies come onto the scene, driven by entrepreneurs, that take advantage of this new angle
	3. Incumbent companies are too ossified and stagnant to shift gears to take advantage of this new angle
	4. The new companies, using advantages from 1 and taking advantage of weaknesses in 3, dislodge incumbent companies
	5. The incumbent companies shrink and/or die
	6. The new, high-growth companies eventually become the new incumbents and the cycle repeats at Step 1
- This cycle ensures that, while no single company survives for eternity, the *system itself* survives and grows more efficient and prosperous. And crucially - **virtually everything about the companies within the system can change.** They can have different governance structures, different incentive structures, leverage different technologies, target different market segments, etc.
- **There is no equivalent process for change in nation-states.** We enshrine most of how the government in constitutions that either don't change (the US) or change frequently on the margins while keeping the same general governmental structure (Latin America). The only mechanism for large scale governmental change appears to be total collapse of the existing order, which can come through: 
	- Violent revolution from within 
	- Conquest from without
	- Loss in a major war (without actually being conquered), resulting in dissolving the existing government (e.g. Germany after WW1)
- Formerly, the structure of a democratic republic served this role fairly well. If a president and his cabinet performed poorly in the past, they could be voted out and a new government would take its place. Two factors today are making this less true:
	1. Politicians are getting older and staying around for longer
		- Why?:
			- Increasing lifespan with no term limits imposed on Congress
			- Mass media & a larger voting populace (who are mostly uninformed) makes name recognition a huge determiner of success. Being around for longer makes for more name recognition and improved election prospects
	2. The Supreme Court is more important than in the past (making frequent decisions that directly affect laws) and has lifetime appointments
	3. The bureaucratic apparatus surrounding the government has increased in size and does *not* get replaced in every administration, so the personnel and ideologies making up the government are more constant from administration to administration
- All of these factors together make the US government increasingly brittle - it is less able to change in response to rapidly changing environments, and so is likely to break. Think of the difference between a wood plan and water. Water changes in response to even tiny perturbations, but the benefit is that will not "break" from a large impact. By contrast, a wood plank will resist most changes until one change that is large enough to overcome it snaps it in half. The increased rigidity of the US government has now made it more likely to break in response to extreme stress and environmental/sociological change.
- Some factors that might improve the situation are:
	- Radically reducing the size and scope of government agencies
	- Setting expiry dates on all government legislation
	- Imposing term limits on Congress and the Supreme Court
	- Implementing cognitive testing for all elected officials
