# Notes
## Therapeutic Peptides: Current Applications and Future Directions
- Therapeutic peptides are a unique class of pharmaceutical agents composed of a series of well-ordered amino acids, usually with molecular weights of 500-5000 Da
	- For reference, the average amino acid has a weight of 110 Da. So this works out to only about 5-50 amino acids per peptide
- Existing peptide therapies include insulin and adrenocroticotrophic hormone
- A total of 33 non-insulin peptide drugs have been approved worldwide since 2000
	- These peptide drugs are no longer simply hormone mimics or composed simply of natural amino acids. For example, enfuvirtide is a 36-amino acid biomimetic peptide mimicking human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) proteins used in combination therapy for the treatment of HIV-1
- Peptides are a large and growing portion of the pharma market. Worldwide sales of more than $70 billion in 2019, a more than two-fold increase compared to 2013
	- Top 200 drug sales in 2019 included 10 non-insulin peptide drugs
		- The top three sales of peptide drugs were all GLP-1 analogues (ozempic)
- Therapeutic peptides commonly act as hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, ion channel ligands, or anti-infective agents.
- Therapeutic peptides bind to cell surface receptors and trigger intracellular effects with high affinity and specificity, with a similar mode of action to biologics.
	- However, compared to biologics, therapeutic peptides show less immunogenicity and have lower production costs
- Small molecules have some advantages over peptides including: ability to be administered orally, low production costs, and good membrane penetration ability
	- Disadvantages when compared to peptides include:
		- Their small size also means that it is difficult for them to inhibit large surface interactions, such as protein-protein interactions (PPIs), effectively. PPIs usually occupy a contact area of 1500–3000 A^2 , while small molecules only cover 300–1000 A^2 of the protein surface, due to their limited molecular size. By contrast, **the unique physiochemical properties of peptide drugs, including their larger size and more flexible backbone, enable them to act as potent inhibitors of PPIs**
		- The clinical use of small molecules is also limited by their low specificity compared with peptide drugs.
- As natural amino acid-based therapeutics, therapeutic peptides have two intrinsic drawbacks:
	1. **Membrane impermeability.** The membrane permeability of peptide drugs depends on multiple factors, including peptide length and amino acid composition. Peptides are generally unable to cross the cell membrane to target intracellular targets, thus limiting their applications in drug development
	2. **Poor *in vivo* stability.** Natural peptides consist of chains of amino acids joined by amide bonds, but lack the stability conferred by secondary or tertiary structures. The amide bonds can be easily hydrolyzed or destroyed by enzymes in vivo, upon exposure to the environment, without any protection. These inherent chemical properties make the peptides chemically and physically unstable, with a short half-life and fast elimination in vivo
![[Pasted image 20240711101749.png]]
- **Development path of therapeutic peptides:**
	- **Natural peptides/hormones in the human body.** The history of peptide drug discovery started by exploiting natural hormones and peptides with well-studied physiological functions for treating diseases caused by hormone deficiencies (e.g. insulin)
	- **Peptides mimicking hormones.** For example, extensive efforts have been made to modify the sequence of GLP-1 (a 37-amino acid peptide that regulates insulin production and secretion) to enhance its stability while maintaining potency and pharmacological effects. These modifications led to new peptides (like semaglutide, aka ozempic) that mimic the function of GLP-1 but have different amino acid sequences
	- **Peptides identified from natural products.** Many bioactive peptides from bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals possess therapeutic properties, such as snake venom, which is considered as a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) analogue. **Non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs)** comprise another class of peptides identified from natural products. The non-standard residues contained in the sequence mean that **NRPs are not produced through the traditional biosynthesis pathways via ribosomes, but are produced by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases** via a pathway consisting of initiation, elongation, and termination module. Compared with peptides synthesized by ribosomes, NRPs are more resistant to hydrolases and show increased stability in vivo. The synthesis and structure-activity relationships study of NRPs represent one of the most challenging and exciting areas of research for NRPs
	- **Rational design of peptides based on protein-protein interactions (PPIs).** Over 14,000 PPIs, accounting for only about 1% of all PPIs in the human body, have been studied to date. PPIs regulate many essential cellular pathways in human diseases and are thus potential drug targets. Peptides contain intrinsic advantages as inhibitors or activators of PPIs compared with small molecules and antibodies. Therefore, a new peptide drug discovery technology based on the known crystal structure of PPIs has thus been developed: the rational design of peptides
		- The rational design of peptides involves computer-assisted bioinformatics technology based on the resolved crystal structure of the target PPIs. **Bioinformatic and computational analysis of the PPI binding interface enables the essential amino acids on the surface of the two interacting proteins to be identified. These essential amino acids contribute the major Gibbs energy of the PPIs and are commonly called “hotspots”.** Hotspots may be a continuous fragment of the protein or dispersed residues on different secondary structures of the protein. **The design of peptide modulators for PPIs is based on these hotspots**, either directly using the continuous fragment or using a strategy to link the dispersed residues as initial sequences.
	- **Discovery of peptide drug candidates by phage display.** Phage display uses recombinant technologies to engineer target ligands on the surface of the bacteriophage. This high-throughput sequencing method can be used to identify drug leads, including antibodies and peptides. Phage display has been widely used to discover new peptide ligands
		- **Phage display** is a laboratory technique for the study of [protein–protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein%E2%80%93protein_interaction "Protein–protein interaction"), [protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein "Protein")–[peptide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide "Peptide"), and protein–[DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA") interactions that uses [bacteriophages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage "Bacteriophage") ([viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viruses "Viruses") that infect [bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria "Bacteria")) to connect proteins with the [genetic information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_information "Genetic information") that [encodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code "Code") them.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_display#cite_note-Smith_1985-1) In this technique, a gene encoding a protein of interest is inserted into a phage [coat protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_coat_protein "Viral coat protein") gene, causing the phage to "display" the protein on its outside while containing the gene for the protein on its inside, resulting in a connection between [genotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype "Genotype") and [phenotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype "Phenotype"). The proteins that the phages are displaying can then be screened against other proteins, peptides or DNA sequences, in order to detect interaction between the displayed protein and those of other molecules. In this way, large [libraries of proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_fragment_library "Protein fragment library") can be screened and [amplified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplification_(molecular_biology) "Amplification (molecular biology)") in a process called _[in vitro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro "In vitro")_ selection, which is analogous to [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection "Natural selection").
		
- **Synthesis and Modification of Therapeutic Peptides**
	- **Chemical synthesis of peptides.** Solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) technology facilitates peptide synthesis by combining amino acid coupling and deprotection in one simple reactor, which has further led to the invention of automatic peptide synthesizers. Very well-developed, brought to market by Merrifield in 1963
		- Chemical synthesis is the preferred method for the industrial preparation of peptides, because it can introduce versatile synthetic building blocks beyond the proteinogenic amino acids, such as unnatural amino acids, and biochemical or biophysical probes, allowing further modification or conjugation. Furthermore, the chemical synthesis process can be fully automated and easily scaled up. It provides a convenient and efficient approach for producing short- and medium-sized peptides, but the chemical synthesis of long peptides remains challenging, and alternative strategies are therefore required.
	- **Chemical modification of peptide and peptidomimetics.** The biological activity of peptides is intimately related to their chemical structure. Following the synthesis of peptides, they need to be modified using medicinal chemistry techniques to mimic, stabilize, or construct an ideal secondary structure to improve their biological activity and achieve selectivity, stability, and solubility of the peptide drug
	- **Backbone modification of peptides.** One of the main reasons for backbone modification is to improve the proteolytic stability of the peptide. Backbone modification includes the substitution of L-amino acids by D-amino acids insertion of methylamino acids, and the incorporation of β-amino acids and peptoids. Introducing these non-natural amino acids into the peptide sequence, particularly at the proteolysis site, is an effective strategy for extending the plasma half-life of peptide drugs
	- **Side chain modification of peptides.** Side chain modification of peptides is achieved by replacing the natural amino acids with their analogues during peptide synthesis, to improve their binding affinity and target selectivity
	- **Mimicking and stabilization of secondary structures by backbone and side chain modification.** The weak forces in peptides, such as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and intramolecular hydrophobic interactions are not adequate for a stable secondary structure conformation. Additional modifications of the backbone, N- or C-termini, or sidechains to mimic the structures of natural products or hot spots in PPI and stabilization of secondary structures are therefore needed to produce promising peptide drug candidates
	- **Peptide production by recombinant technology.** In addition to chemical synthesis, therapeutic peptides can be prepared by various biological methods, such as isolating bioactive peptides from natural sources by extraction, enzymatic synthesis, fermentation, recombinant DNA technology, and semisynthesis. These approaches can be applied exclusively or in combination, depending on the complexity and difficulty of preparing the peptide
		- Recombinant DNA technology enables the production of peptides and proteins with defined sequences and homogeneity. This approach is particularly useful for manufacturing long or complicated peptides with multiple disulfide bonds, which can otherwise be difficult to synthesize chemically. Human insulin and growth hormone are representative examples of the many available peptide drugs made using recombinant DNA technology. In addition, recombinant DNA technology can be combined with genetic code expansion and other novel technologies to introduce desired functional groups into the molecules via the incorporation of unnatural amino acids, as discussed below
	- **Peptides modification by genetic code expansion.** Natural proteins are synthesized from 20 canonical amino acids, and this limited and conservative repertoire of amino acids significantly restricts the diversity and complexity of protein structures and functions. Genetic code expansion was developed two decades ago as a technology to overcome this limitation. Genetic code expansion allows for the site-specific incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) with novel chemical and physical properties into a growing polypeptide during protein translation. The ability to genetically encode diverse ncAAs allows for the rational optimization and production of chemically modified recombinant proteins with defined structures, functions, and stoichiometries. Four components are required to achieve this:
		1. An ncAA with the desired chemical and physical properties
		2. A unique codon that specifies the ncAA, e.g., an amber stop codon (UAG) or a quadruplet codon
		3. An orthogonal tRNA that suppresses the unique codon and does not crosstalk with its endogenous counterparts
		4. An orthogonal amino-acyl tRNA synthetase that can specifically charge the ncAA onto the orthgoonal tRNA and does not crosstalk with the endogenous amino-acyl tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs.
	- **PEGylation of peptides and proteins.** Short protein and peptide therapeutics produced by genetic code expansion also have a short half-life because of their poor pharmacokinetics, including fast serum degradation and quick elimination. Attaching a polymer is one approach for extending the half-life of protein therapeutics (see below image)
		- **PEGylation** (or **pegylation**) is the process of both covalent and non-covalent attachment or amalgamation of [polyethylene glycol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol "Polyethylene glycol") (PEG, in pharmacy called [macrogol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrogol "Macrogol")) polymer chains to molecules and macrostructures, such as a drug, therapeutic protein or vesicle, which is then described as **PEGylated**. PEGylation affects the resulting derivatives or aggregates interactions, which typically slows down their coalescence and degradation as well as elimination in vivo.
		- PEGylation is the process of attaching the strands of the polymer PEG to molecules, most typically [peptides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptides "Peptides"), [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteins "Proteins"), and [antibody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody "Antibody") fragments, that can improve the safety and efficiency of many [therapeutics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutics "Therapeutics").It produces alterations in the physiochemical properties including changes in [conformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure "Chemical structure"), [electrostatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic "Electrostatic") [binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding "Molecular binding"), [hydrophobicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobicity "Hydrophobicity") etc. These physical and chemical changes increase systemic retention of the therapeutic agent. Also, it can influence the binding affinity of the therapeutic moiety to the cell receptors and can alter the absorption and distribution patterns.
		- PEGylation, by increasing the molecular weight of a [molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule"), can impart several significant pharmacological advantages over the unmodified form, such as improved [drug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug "Drug") solubility, reduced dosage frequency with potentially reduced [toxicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity "Toxicity") and without diminished efficacy, extended circulating life, increased [drug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug "Drug") stability, and enhanced protection from proteolytic degradation; PEGylated forms may also be eligible for patent protection

	**Figure Caption:** A comparison of [uricase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uricase "Uricase") and [PEG-uricase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEG-uricase "PEG-uricase"); PEG-uricase includes 40 polymers of 10kDa PEG. PEGylation improves its solubility at physiological pH, increases serum half-life and reduces immunogenicity without compromising activity. Upper images show the whole tetramer, lower images show one of the lysines that is PEGylated. (uricase from [PDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank "Protein Data Bank"): [1uox](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1uox)​ and PEG-uricase [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics "Molecular dynamics") from reference; only 36 PEG polymers included)

	- **Covalent peptide/protein drugs.** Targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) or Targeted [covalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond "Covalent bond") [drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drugs "Drugs") are rationally designed [inhibitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor "Enzyme inhibitor") that bind and then [bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond "Chemical bond") to their [target proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_protein "Target protein"). These inhibitors possess a bond-forming [functional group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group "Functional group") of low [chemical reactivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactivity_(chemistry) "Reactivity (chemistry)") that, following binding to the target protein, is positioned to react rapidly with a proximate [nucleophilic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleophile "Nucleophile") [residue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid "Amino acid") at the target site to form a bond. These inhibitors react with their target proteins to form a covalent complex in which the protein has lost its function. Aside from small molecules, covalent probes are also being derived from peptides or proteins. By incorporation of a reactive group into a binding peptide or protein via [posttranslational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-translational_modification "Post-translational modification") chemical modification or as an [unnatural amino acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-proteinogenic_amino_acids "Non-proteinogenic amino acids"), a target protein can be conjugated specifically via proximity-induced reaction.

	**Figure Caption:** This illustration describes the mechanism by which covalent drugs irreversibly bind and modify the protein, e.g. silencing its activity
		
	- **Developments in peptide drug delivery.** Peptide modifications allow peptides to achieve better activity and plasma stability, and become more drug-like. However, the inherent properties of peptides mean that they are easily hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes in the stomach and intestine, and most peptide drugs are thus administrated by injection. Recent studies have investigated routes of peptide drug delivery to overcome these drawbacks
		- Co-formulation with permeation enhancers is a promising strategy to enable the oral administration of peptide drugs. Semaglutide conjugated with C18 fatty acid was approved for administration by once-weekly subcutaneous injection276,277, with greater plasma stability than other GLP-1 analogues. Even more encouragingly, the co-formulation of semaglutide with sodium N-8-(2-hydroxybenzoyl amino caprylate (SNAC) was approved for oral administration to treat T2DM. Co-formulation with SNAC prevents the destruction of semaglutide in the stomach by decreasing the efficacy of digestive enzymes.
